A movement,\r\nrecalling the Renaissance, laid hold of the spirit of painters. In all\r\nstudios artists spoke a language which had never been heard there\r\nbefore; all great reputations were overthrown; the most celebrated\r\nCinquecentisti, whose names had hitherto been mentioned with respectful\r\nawe, were referred to with a shrug as bunglers. A miracle seemed to have\r\ntaken place in the world, for the muse of painting was removed from the\r\npedestal on which she had stood for three centuries and set up in\r\ntriumph upon another.\r\n\r\nTo understand fully the aims of pre-Raphaelitism it is necessary to\r\nrecall the character of the age which gave it birth.\r\n\r\nAfter English art had had its beginning with the great national masters\r\nand enjoyed a prime of real splendour, it became, about the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century, the prey to a tedious disease. A series of crude\r\nhistorical painters endeavoured to fathom the noble style of the Italian\r\nCinquecento, without rising above the level of intelligent plagiarism.\r\nAs brilliant decorative artists possessed of pomp and majesty, and\r\nsensuously affected by plastic beauty, as worshippers of the nude human\r\nform, and as modern Greeks, the Italian classic painters were the worst\r\nconceivable guides for a people who in every artistic achievement have\r\npursued spiritual expression in preference to plastic beauty. But in\r\nspite of the experiences gained since the time of Hogarth, they all went\r\non the pilgrimage to Rome, as to a sacred spring, drank their fill in\r\nlong draughts, and came back poisoned. Even Wilkie, that charming\r\n"little master," who did the work of a pioneer so long as he followed\r\nthe congenial Flemish painters and the Dutch, even Wilkie lost every\r\ntrace of individuality after seeing Spain and Italy. As this imitation\r\nof the high Renaissance period led to forced and affected sentiment, it\r\nalso developed an empty academical technique. In accordance with the\r\nprecepts of the Cinquecento, artists proceeded with an affected ease to\r\nmake brief work of everything, contenting themselves with a superficial\r\n_fa\xc3\xa7ade_ effect. A painting based on dexterity of hand took the place of\r\nthe religious study of nature, and a banal arrangement after celebrated\r\nmodels took the place of inward absorption.\r\n\r\nIt was to no purpose that certain painters, such as _F. C. Horsley_, _J.\r\nR. Herbert_, _J. Tenniel_, _Edwin Long_, _E. M. Ward_, and _Eastlake_,\r\nthe English Piloty, by imitation of the Flemish and Venetian masters,\r\nmade more of a return from idealism of form to colour, and that _Edwin\r\nArmitage_, who had studied in Paris and Munich, introduced Continental\r\ninfluences. They are the Delaroche, Gallait, and Bi\xc3\xa8fve of England.\r\nTheir art was an imposing scene painting, their programme always that of\r\nthe school of Bologna--the mother of all academies, great and\r\nsmall--borrowing drawing from Michael Angelo and colour from Titian;\r\ntaking the best from every one, putting it all into a pot, and shaking\r\nit together. Thus English art lost the peculiar national stamp which it\r\nhad had under Reynolds and Gainsborough, Constable and Turner. It became\r\nan insignificant tributary of the false art which then held sway over\r\nthe Continent, insincere towards nature, full of empty rhetorical\r\npassion, and bound to the most vacant routine. And as the grand painting\r\nbecame hollow and mannered, _genre_ painting grew Philistine and\r\ndecrepit. Its innocent childishness and conventional optimism had led to\r\na tedious anecdotic painting. It repeated, like a talkative old man, the\r\nmost insipid tales, and did so with a complacency that never wavered and\r\nwith an unpleasant motley of colour. The English school still existed in\r\nlandscape, but for everything else it was dead.\r\n\r\nA need for reform became urgent all the sooner because literature too\r\nhad diverged into new lines. In poetry there was the influence of the\r\nLake poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, who had simplicity, direct feeling\r\nfor nature, and a Rousseau-like pantheism inscribed as a device upon\r\ntheir banner, and it came as a reaction against the dazzling imaginative\r\nfervour of those great and forceful men of genius Byron and Shelley.\r\nKeats had again uttered the phrase which had before been Shaftesbury\'s\r\ngospel: "Beauty is truth, truth beauty." In the year 1843 John Ruskin\r\npublished the first volume of his _Modern Painters_, the \xc3\xa6sthetic creed\r\nof which culminated in the tenet that nature alone could be the source\r\nof all true art.\r\n\r\nThis transitional spirit, which strove for liberty from the academical\r\nyoke, though diffidently at first, is represented in painting by the\r\nScotch artist _William Dyce_. In England he pursued, though undoubtedly\r\nwith greater ability, a course parallel to that of the German Nazarenes,\r\nwhose faith he championed. Born in 1806, he had in Italy, in the year\r\n1826, made the acquaintance of Overbeck, who won him over to Perugino\r\nand Raphael. Protesting against the histrionic emptiness of English\r\nhistorical painting, he took refuge with the Quattrocentisti and the\r\nyoung Raphael. His masterpiece, the Westminster frescoes, with the\r\nArthurian legends as their subject, goes to some extent on parallel\r\nlines with Schnorr\'s frescoes on the Nibelungen myths. The\r\nrepresentation of vigorous manhood and tempestuous heroism has been here\r\nattempted without sentimentality or theatrical heroics. In his oil\r\npictures--Madonnas, "Bacchus nursed by the Nymphs," "The Woman of\r\nSamaria," "Christ in Gethsemane," "St. John leading Home the Virgin,"\r\netc.--he makes a surprising effect by the graceful, sensuous charm of\r\nhis women, by his exquisite landscapes and his tender idyllic\r\ncharacters. The charming work "Jacob and Rachel," which represents\r\nhim in the Hamburg Kunsthalle, might be ascribed to F\xc3\xbchrich, except that\r\nthe developed feeling for colour bears witness to its English origin.\r\nWith yearning the youth hastens to the maiden, who stands, leaning\r\nagainst the edge of the well, with her eyes cast down, half repulsing\r\nhim in her austere chastity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EASTLAKE.   CHRIST BLESSING LITTLE CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  DYCE.   JACOB AND RACHEL.]\r\n\r\nWhere the Nazarenes obtain a pallid, corpse-like effect, a deep and\r\nluminous quality of colour delights one in his pictures. He is\r\nessentially graceful, and with this grace he combines the pure and quiet\r\nsimplicity of the Umbrian masters. There is something touching in\r\ncertain of his Madonnas, who, in long, clinging raiment, appeal to the\r\nGodhead with arms half lifted, devout lips parted in prayer, and mild\r\nglances lost in infinity. A dreamy loveliness brings the heavenly\r\nfigures nearer to us. Dyce expresses the magic of downcast lids with\r\nlong, dark lashes. Like the Umbrians, he delights in the elasticity of\r\nslender limbs and the chaste grace of blossoming maiden beauty. Many\r\nGerman fresco painters have become celebrated who never achieved\r\nanything equal in artistic merit to the Westminster pictures of Dyce.\r\nYet he is to be reckoned with the Flandrin-Overbeck family, since he\r\ngives a repetition of the young Raphael, though he certainly does it\r\nwell; but he only imitates and has not improved upon him.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of another Scotchman, _Sir Joseph No\xc3\xabl Paton_, born in\r\n1821, appear at a rather later date. Most of them--"The Quarrel of\r\nOberon and Titania," "The Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania" in the\r\nEdinburgh Gallery, and his masterpiece, "The Fairy Queen"--have, from\r\nthe \xc3\xa6sthetic standpoint, little enjoyment to offer. The drawing is hard,\r\nthe composition overladen, the colour scattered and motley. As in Ary\r\nScheffer, all the figures have vapid, widely opened eyes. Elves, gnomes,\r\nwomen, knights, and fantastic rocks are crowded so tightly together that\r\nthe frame scarcely holds them. But the loving study of nature in the\r\nseparate parts is extraordinary. It is possible to give a botanical\r\ndefinition of each plant and each flower in the foreground, with so much\r\ncharacter and such care has Paton executed every leaf and every blossom,\r\neven the tiny creeping things amid the meadow grass. Here and there a\r\nfresh ray of morning sun breaks through the light green and leaps from\r\nblade to blade. The landscapes of Albrecht Altdorfer are recalled to\r\nmind. Emancipation from empty, heroically impassioned emphasis,\r\npantheistic adoration of nature, even a certain effort--unsuccessful\r\nindeed--after an independent sentiment for colour, are what his pictures\r\nseem to preach in their na\xc3\xafve angularity, their loving execution of\r\ndetail, and their bright green motley.\r\n\r\nThis was the mood of the young artists who united to form the\r\npre-Raphaelite group of 1848. They were students at the Royal Academy of\r\nfrom twenty to four-and-twenty years of age. The first of the group,\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti, had already written some of his poems. The\r\nsecond, Holman Hunt, had still a difficulty in overcoming the opposition\r\nof his father, who was not pleased to see him giving up a commercial\r\ncareer. John Everett Millais, the youngest, had made most progress as a\r\npainter, and was one of the best pupils at the Academy. But they were\r\ncontented neither by the artistic achievement of their teachers nor by\r\nthe method of instruction. Etty, the most valued of them all, according\r\nto the account of Holman Hunt, painted mythological pictures, full of\r\nempty affectation; Mulready drew in a diluted fashion, and sacrificed\r\neverything to elegance; Maclise had fallen into patriotic banalities;\r\nDyce had stopped short in his course and begun again when it was too\r\nlate. Thus they had of necessity to provide their own training for\r\nthemselves. All three worked in the same studio; and it so happened that\r\none day--in 1847 or 1848--chance threw into their hands some engravings\r\nof Benozzo Gozzoli\'s Campo-Santo frescoes in Pisa. Nature and\r\ntruth--everything which they had dimly surmised, and had missed in the\r\nproductions of English art--here they were. Overcome with admiration for\r\nthe sparkling life, the intensity of feeling, and the vigorous form of\r\nthese works, which did not even shrink from the consequences of\r\nugliness, they were agreed in recognising that art had always stood on\r\nthe basis of nature until the end of the fifteenth century, or, more\r\nexactly, until the year 1508, when Raphael left Florence to paint in the\r\nVatican in Rome. Since then everything had gone wrong; art had stripped\r\noff the simple garment of natural truthfulness and fallen into\r\nconventional phrases, which in the course of centuries had become more\r\nand more empty and repellent by vapid repetition. Was it necessary that\r\nthe persons in pictures should, to the end of the world, stand and move\r\njust as they had done a thousand times in the works of the\r\nCinquecentisti? Was it necessary that human emotions--love, boldness,\r\nremorse, and renunciation--should always be expressed by the same turn\r\nof the head, the same lift of the eyebrows, the same gesture of the\r\narms, and the same folded hands, which came into vogue through the\r\nCinquecentisti? Where in nature are the rounded forms which Raphael, the\r\nfirst Classicist, borrowed from the antique? And in the critical moments\r\nof life do people really form themselves into such carefully balanced\r\ngroups, with the one who chances to have on the finest clothes in the\r\ncentre?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Annan, photo._\r\n\r\n  PATON.   THE RECONCILIATION OF OBERON AND TITANIA.]\r\n\r\nFrom this reaction against the Cinquecentisti and against the shallow\r\nimitation of them, the title pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the secret,\r\nmasonic sign P.R.B., which they added to their signatures upon their\r\npictures, are rendered comprehensible. But whilst Dyce, to avoid the\r\nCinquecentisti, imitated the Quattrocentisti, the title here is only\r\nmeant to signify that these artists, like the Quattrocentisti, had\r\ndetermined to go back to the original source of real life. The Academy\r\npupils Rossetti, Millais, and Holman Hunt, together with the young\r\nsculptor Thomas Woolner, who had just left school, were at first the\r\nonly members of the Brotherhood. Later the _genre_ painter James\r\nCollinson, the painter and critic F. G. Stephens, and Rossetti\'s\r\nbrother, William Michael Rossetti, were admitted to the alliance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLMAN HUNT.   THE SCAPEGOAT.\r\n\r\n  (_By Permission of Messrs. Henry Graves & Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nBoldly they declared war against all conventional rules, described\r\nthemselves as beginners and their pictures as attempts, and announced\r\nthemselves to be, at any rate, sincere. The programme of their school\r\nwas truth; not imitation of the old masters, but strict and keen study\r\nof nature such as the old masters had practised themselves. They were in\r\nreaction against the superficial dexterity of technique and the beauty\r\nof form and intellectual emptiness to which the English historical\r\npicture had fallen victim; they were in reaction against the trivial\r\nbanality which disfigured English _genre_ painting. In the\r\nrepresentation of passion the true gestures of nature were to be\r\nrendered, without regard to grace and elegance, and without the stock\r\nproperties of pantomime. The end for which they strove was to be true\r\nand not to create what was essentially untrue by a borrowed idealism\r\nwhich had an appearance of being sublime. In opposition to the negligent\r\npainting of the artists of their age, they demanded slavishly faithful\r\nimitation of the model by detail, carried out with microscopic\r\nexactness. Nothing was to be done without reverence for nature; every\r\npart of a picture down to the smallest blade or leaf was to be directly\r\npainted from the original. Even at the expense of total effect every\r\npicture was to be carried out in minutest detail. It was better to\r\nstammer than to make empty phrases. A young and vigorous art, such as\r\nhad been in the fifteenth century, could win its way, as they believed,\r\nfrom this conception alone.\r\n\r\nIn all these points, in the revolt against the emptiness of the _beaut\xc3\xa9\r\nsupr\xc3\xaame_ and the flowing lines of the accepted routine of composition,\r\nthey were at one with Courbet and Millet. It was only in further\r\ndevelopments that the French and English parted company; English realism\r\nreceived a specifically English tinge. Since every form of\r\nClassicism--for to this point they were led by the train of their\r\nideas--declares the ideal completion of form, of physical presentment,\r\nto be its highest aim, the standard-bearers of realism were obliged to\r\nseek the highest aim of their art, founded exclusively on the study of\r\nnature, in the representation of moral and intellectual life, in a\r\nthoughtful form of spiritual creation. The blending of realism with\r\nprofundity of ideas, of uncompromising truth to nature in form with\r\nphilosophic and poetic substance, is of the very essence of the\r\npre-Raphaelites. They are transcendental naturalists, equally widely\r\nremoved from Classicism, which deals only with beautiful bodies, as from\r\nrealism proper, which only proposes to represent a fragment of nature.\r\nFrom opposition to abstract beauty of form they insist upon what is\r\ncharacteristic, energetic, angular; but their figures painted faithfully\r\nfrom nature are the vehicles of a metaphysical idea. From the first they\r\nsaturated themselves with poetry. Holman Hunt has an enthusiasm for\r\nKeats and the Bible, Rossetti for Dante, Millais for the medi\xc3\xa6val poems\r\nof chivalry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLMAN HUNT.   THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. L. H. Lef\xc3\xa8vre, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mag. of Art._\r\n\r\n  FORD MADOX BROWN.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Theodore Watts Dunton, Esq., the owner of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nAll three appeared before the public for the first time in the year\r\n1849. John Millais and Holman Hunt exhibited in the Royal Academy, the\r\none being represented by his "Lorenzo and Isabella," a subject drawn\r\nfrom Keats, the other by his "Rienzi." Rossetti had his picture, "The\r\nGirlhood of Mary Virgin," exhibited at the Free Exhibition, afterwards\r\nknown as the Portland Gallery. All three works excited attention and\r\nalso derision, and much shaking of heads. The three next works of\r\n1850--"A Converted British Family sheltering a Christian Missionary," by\r\nHolman Hunt; "The Child Jesus in the Workshop of Joseph the Carpenter,"\r\nby Millais; and "The Annunciation" by Rossetti--were received with the\r\nsame amused contempt. When they exhibited for the third time--Holman\r\nHunt, a scene from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_; Millais, "The Return\r\nof the Dove to the Ark" and "The Woodman\'s Daughter"--such a storm of\r\nexcitement broke forth that the pictures had to be removed from the\r\nexhibition. A furious article appeared in _The Art Journal_; the\r\nexhibitors, it was said, were certainly young, but they were too old to\r\ncommit such sins of youth. Even Dickens turned against them in\r\n_Household Words_. The painters who had been assailed made their answer.\r\nWilliam Michael Rossetti laid down the principles of the Brotherhood by\r\nan article in a periodical called _The Critic_, and smuggled a second\r\narticle into _The Spectator_. In 1850 they founded a monthly magazine\r\nfor the defence of their theories, _The Germ_, which on the third number\r\ntook the title _Art and Poetry_, and was most charmingly embellished\r\nwith drawings by Holman Hunt, Madox Brown, and others. Stephens\r\npublished an essay in it, on the ways and aims of the early Italians,\r\nwhich gave him occasion to discuss the works recently produced in the\r\nspirit of simplicity known to these old masters. Madox Brown wrote a\r\npaper on historical painting, in which he asserted that the true basis\r\nof historical painting must be strict fidelity to the model, to the\r\nexclusion of all generalisation and beautifying, and exact antiquarian\r\nstudy of costumes and furniture in contradistinction to the fancy\r\nhistory of the elder painters. But all these articles were written to no\r\npurpose. After the fourth number the magazine was stopped, and in these\r\ndays it has become a curiosity for bibliomaniacs. But support came from\r\nanother side. Holman Hunt\'s picture dealing with a scene from\r\nShakespeare\'s _Two Gentlemen of Verona_ received the most trenchant\r\ncondemnation in _The Times_. John Ruskin came forward as his champion\r\nand replied on 13th May 1851. _The Times_ contained yet a second letter\r\nfrom him on 30th May. And soon afterwards both were issued as a\r\npamphlet, with the title _Pre-Raphaelitism_, _its Principles, and\r\nTurner_. These works, he said, did not imitate old pictures, but nature;\r\nwhat alienated the public in them was their truth and rightness, which\r\nhad broken abruptly and successfully with the conventional sweep of\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mag. of Art._\r\n\r\n  FORD MADOX BROWN.   LEAR AND CORDELIA.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Albert Wood, Esq., the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\n_Holman Hunt_ is the painter who has been most consistent in clinging\r\nthroughout his life to these original principles of the Brotherhood. He\r\nis distinguished by a depth of thought which at last tends to become\r\nentirely elusive, and often a depth of spirit more profound than diver\r\never plumbed; but at the same time by an angular, gnarled realism which\r\nhas scarcely its equal in all the European art of the century.\r\n\r\n"The Flight of Madeleine and Porphyro," from Keats\' _Eve of St. Agnes_,\r\nwas the first picture, the subject being borrowed in 1848 from his\r\nfavourite poet. In the work through which he first acknowledged himself\r\na member of the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood he has given a plain and\r\nsimple rendering of the scene in the introductory chapter of Bulwer\r\nLytton\'s _Rienzi_. He has chosen the moment when Rienzi, kneeling beside\r\nthe corpse of his brother, takes a vow of vengeance against the murderer\r\nwho is riding away. The composition avoids any kind of conventional\r\npyramidal structure. In the foreground every flower is painted and every\r\ncolour is frankly set beside its neighbour without the traditional\r\ngradation. His third picture, "A Converted British Family sheltering a\r\nChristian Missionary," is not to be reckoned amongst his best\r\nperformances. It is forced na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9, suggesting the old masters, to unite\r\ntwo entirely different scenes upon the same canvas: in the background\r\nthere are fugitives and pursuers, and a Druid, merely visible by his\r\noutstretched arms, inciting the populace to the murder of a missionary;\r\nin the foreground a hut open on all sides, which could really offer no\r\nprotection at all. Yet in this hut a priest is hiding, tended by\r\nconverted Britons. However, the drawing of the nude bodies is an\r\nadmirable piece of realism; admirable, also, is the way in which he has\r\nexpressed the fear of the inmates, and the fanatical bloodthirsty rage\r\nof the pursuers, and this without any false heroics, without any\r\nrhetoric based upon the traditional language of gesture. The picture\r\nfrom Shakespeare\'s _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, with the motto, "Death is\r\na fearful thing, and shamed life a hateful," is perhaps theatrical in\r\nits arrangement, though it is likewise earnest and convincing in\r\npsychological expression.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic fidelity to nature, which formed the first principle in the\r\nprogramme of the Brotherhood, has been carried in Holman Hunt to the\r\nhighest possible point. Every flower and every ear of corn, every\r\nfeather and every blade of grass, every fragment of bark on the trees\r\nand every muscle, is painted with scrupulous accuracy. The joke made\r\nabout the pre-Raphaelites has reference to Holman Hunt: it was said that\r\nwhen they had to paint a landscape they used to bring to their studio a\r\nblade of grass, a leaf, and a piece of bark, and they multiplied them\r\nmicroscopically so many thousand times until the landscape was finished.\r\nHis works are a triumph of industry, and for that very reason they are\r\nnot a pleasure to the eye. A petty, pedantic fidelity to nature injures\r\nthe total effect, and the hard colours--pungent green, vivid yellow,\r\nglaring blue, and glowing red--which Holman Hunt places immediately\r\nbeside each other, give his pictures something brusque, barbaric, and\r\njarring. But as a reaction against a system of painting by routine,\r\nwhich had become mannered, such truth without all compromise, such\r\npainstaking effort at the utmost possible fidelity to nature, was, in\r\nits very harshness, of epoch-making significance.\r\n\r\nWith regard, also, to the transcendental purport of his pictures Holman\r\nHunt is perhaps the most genuine of the group. In the whole history of\r\nart there are no religious pictures in which uncompromising naturalism\r\nhas made so remarkable an alliance with a pietistic depth of ideas. The\r\nfirst, which he sent to the exhibition of 1854, "The Light of the\r\nWorld," represents Christ wandering through the night in a\r\ngold-embroidered mantle, with a lantern in His hand, like a Divine\r\nDiogenes seeking men. Taine, who studied the picture impartially without\r\nthe catalogue, describes it, without further addition, as "Christ by\r\nnight with a lantern." But for Holman Hunt the meaning is Christianity\r\nilluminating the universe with the mystic light of Faith and seeking\r\nadmission at the long-closed door of unbelief. It was because of this\r\nimplicit suggestion that the work made an indescribable sensation in\r\nEngland; it had to go on pilgrimage from town to town, and hundreds of\r\nthousands of copies of the engraving were sold. The pietistic feeling\r\nof this ascetic preacher was so strong that he was able to venture on\r\npictures like "The Scapegoat" of 1856 without becoming comical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  FORD MADOX BROWN.   ROMEO AND JULIET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORD MADOX BROWN.   CHRIST WASHING PETER\'S FEET.]\r\n\r\nA striving to attain the greatest possible local truth had led Holman\r\nHunt to the East when he began these biblical pictures. He spent several\r\nyears in Palestine studying the topographical character of the land, its\r\nbuildings and its people, and endeavoured with the help of these actual\r\nmen and women and these landscape scenes to reconstruct the events of\r\nbiblical history with antiquarian fidelity. To paint "The Shadow of\r\nDeath" he searched in the East until he discovered a Jew who\r\ncorresponded to his idea of Christ, and painted him, a strong, powerful\r\nman, the genuine son of a carpenter, with that astounding truth to\r\nnature with which Hubert van Eyck painted his Adam. Even the hairs of\r\nthe breast and legs are as faithfully rendered as if one saw the model\r\nin a glass. Near this naked carpenter--for He is clothed only with a\r\nleather apron--there kneels a modern Eastern woman, bowed over a chest,\r\nin which various Oriental vessels are lying. The ground is covered with\r\nshavings of wood. Up to this point, therefore, it is a naturalistic\r\npicture from the modern East. But here Holman Hunt\'s pietistic sentiment\r\nis seen: it is the eve of a festival; the sun casts its last dying rays\r\ninto the room; the journeyman carpenter wearily stretches out His arms,\r\nand the shadow of His body describes upon the wall the prophetic form of\r\nthe Cross.\r\n\r\nAnother picture represented the discovery of our Lord in the Temple, a\r\nthird the flock which has been astray following the Good Shepherd into\r\nHis Father\'s fold. On his picture of the flight into Egypt, or, as he\r\nhas himself called it, "The Triumph of the Innocents," he published a\r\npamphlet of twelve pages, in which he goes into all the historical\r\nevents connected with the picture with the loyalty of an historian; he\r\ndiscusses everything--in what month the flight took place, and by what\r\nroute, how old Christ was, to what race the ass belonged, and what\r\nclothes were worn by Saint Joseph and Mary. One might be forgiven for\r\nthinking such a production the absurd effusion of a whimsical pedant\r\nwere it not that Hunt is so grimly in earnest in everything he does. In\r\nspite of all his peculiarities it must be admitted that he gave a deep\r\nand earnest religious character to English art, which before his time\r\nhad been so paltry; and this explains the powerful impression which he\r\nmade upon his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe artist most closely allied to him in technique is _Ford Madox\r\nBrown_, who did not reckon himself officially with the pre-Raphaelites,\r\nthough he followed the same principles in what concerned the treatment\r\nof detail. Only a little senior to the founders of the Brotherhood--he\r\nwas nine-and-twenty at the time--he is to be regarded as their more\r\nmature ally and forerunner. Rossetti was under no illusion when, in the\r\nbeginning of his studies, he turned to him directly. In those years\r\nMadox Brown was the only English painter who was not addicted to the\r\ntrivialities of paltry _genre_ painting or the theatrical heroics of\r\ntraditional history. He is a bold artist, with a gift of dramatic force\r\nand a very rare capacity of concentration, and these qualities hindered\r\nhim from following the doctrine of the pre-Raphaelites in all its\r\nconsequences. If he had, in accordance with their programme, exclusively\r\nconfined himself to work from the living model, several of his most\r\nstriking and powerful pictures would never have been painted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  MILLAIS.   LORENZO AND ISABELLA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  MILLAIS.   THE NORTH-WEST PASSAGE.]\r\n\r\nMadox Brown passed his youth on the Continent--in Antwerp with Wappers,\r\nin Paris, and in Rome. The pictures which he painted there in the\r\nbeginning of the forties were produced, as regards technique, under the\r\ninfluence of Wappers. The subjects were taken from Byron: "The Sleep of\r\nParisina" and "Manfred on the Jungfrau." It is only in the latter that\r\nan independent initiative is perceptible. In contradistinction from the\r\ngeneralities of the school of Wappers he aimed at greater depth of\r\npsychology and accuracy of costume, while at the same time he\r\nendeavoured, though without success, to replace the conventional studio\r\nlight by the carefully observed effect of free light. These three\r\nthings--truth of colour, of spiritual expression, and of historical\r\ncharacter--were from this time forth his principal care. And when his\r\ncartoon of "Harold," painted in Paris in the year 1844, was exhibited in\r\nWestminster Hall, it was chiefly this scrupulous effort at truth which\r\nmade such a vivid impression upon the younger generation. In the first\r\nmasterpiece which he painted after his return to London in 1848 he\r\nstands out already in all his rugged individuality. "Lear and Cordelia,"\r\nfounded on a most tragic passage in the most tragic of the great dramas\r\nof Shakespeare, is here treated with impressive cogency. It stood in\r\nsuch abrupt opposition to the traditional historical painting that\r\nperhaps nothing was ever so sharply opposed to anything so universally\r\naccepted. The figures stand out stiff and parti-coloured like card\r\nkings, without fluency of line or rounded and generalised beauty. And\r\nthe colouring is just as incoherent. The brown sauce, which every one\r\nhad hitherto respected like a binding social law, had given way to a\r\nbright joy of colour, the half-barbaric motley which one finds in old\r\nminiatures. It is only when one studies the brilliant details, used\r\nmerely in the service of a great psychological effect, that this\r\noutwardly repellent picture takes shape as a powerful work of art, a\r\nwork of profound human truth. Nothing is sacrificed to pose, graceful\r\nshow, or histrionic affectation. Like the German masters of the\r\nfifteenth century, Madox Brown makes no attempt to dilute what is ugly,\r\nnor did Holbein either when he painted the leprous beggars in his "Altar\r\nto St. Sebastian." Every figure, whether fair or foul, is, in bearing,\r\nexpression, and gesture, a character of robust and rigorous hardihood,\r\nand has that intense fulness of life which is compressed in those carved\r\nwooden figures of medi\xc3\xa6val altars: the aged Lear with his weather-beaten\r\nface and his waving beard; the envious Regan; the cold, cruel, ambitious\r\nGoneril; Albany, with his fair, inexpressive head; the gross, brutal\r\nCornwall; Burgundy, biting his nails in indecision; and Cordelia, in her\r\ntouching, bashful grace. And to this angular frankness of the primitive\r\nmasters he unites the profound learning of the modern historian. All the\r\narch\xc3\xa6ological details, the old British costumes, jewels, modes of\r\nwearing the hair, weapons, furniture, and hangings, have been studied\r\nwith the accuracy of Menzel. He knows nothing of the academic rules of\r\ncomposition, and his robes fall naturally without the petty appendage of\r\nfair folds and graceful motives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILLAIS.   THE HUGUENOT.]\r\n\r\nThe picture in which he treated the balcony scene in Shakespeare\'s\r\n_Romeo and Juliet_ is outwardly repellent, like "Lear and Cordelia," but\r\nwhat a hollow effect is made by Makart\'s theatrical heroics beside this\r\naboriginal sensuousness, this intensity of expression! Juliet\'s dress\r\nhas fallen from her shoulders, and, devoid of will and thought, with\r\nclosed lids, half-naked, and thrilling in every fibre with the lingering\r\njoy of the hours that have passed, she abandons herself to the last\r\nfiery embraces of Romeo, who in stormy haste is feeling with one foot\r\nfor the ladder of ropes.\r\n\r\nHe has solved a yet more difficult problem in the picture "Elijah and\r\nthe Widow."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  MILLAIS.   AUTUMN LEAVES.]\r\n\r\n"See, thy son liveth," are the words in the Bible with which the hoary\r\nElijah brings the boy, raised from death and still enveloped in his\r\nshroud, to the agonised mother kneeling at the foot of the sepulchre.\r\nThe woman makes answer: "Now by this I know that thou art a man of God."\r\nIn the embodiment of this scene likewise Madox Brown has aimed in\r\ncostume and accessories at a complete harmony between the figures and\r\nthe character of the epoch, and has set out with an entirely accurate\r\nstudy of Assyrian and Egyptian monuments. Even the inscription on the\r\nwall and the Egyptian antiquities correspond to ancient originals. At\r\nthe same time the figures have been given the breath of new life. Elijah\r\nlooks more like a wild aboriginal man than a saint of the Cinquecento.\r\nThe ecstasy of the mother, the astonishment of the child whose great\r\neyes, still unaccustomed to the light, gaze into the world again with a\r\ndreamy effort, after having beheld the mysteries of death--these are\r\nthings depicted with an astonishing power. The downright but convincing\r\nmethod in which Hogarth paints the soul has dislodged the hollow,\r\nheroical ideal of beauty of the older historical painting. Madox Brown\'s\r\nconfession of faith, which he formulated as an author, culminates in the\r\ntenet that truth is the means of art, its end being the quickening of\r\nthe soul. This he expresses in two words: "emotional truth."\r\n\r\nWhile Holman Hunt and Madox Brown held fast throughout their lives to\r\nthe pre-Raphaelite principles, pre-Raphaelitism was for _John Everett\r\nMillais_, the youngest of the three, merely a transitory phase, a stage\r\nin his artistic development.\r\n\r\nSir John Millais was born 8th June 1829, in Southampton, where his\r\nfamily had come from Jersey. Thus he is half a Frenchman by descent.\r\nHis childhood was passed in Dinant in Brittany, but when he was nine\r\nyears old he went to a London school of drawing. He was then the little\r\nfair-haired boy in a holland blouse, a broad sash, and a large sailor\'s\r\ncollar, whom John Phillip painted in those days. When eleven he entered\r\nthe Royal Academy, probably being the youngest pupil there; at thirteen\r\nhe won a prize medal for the best drawing from the antique; at fifteen\r\nhe was already painting; and at seventeen he exhibited an historical\r\npicture, "Pizarro seizing the Inca of Peru," which was praised by the\r\ncritics as the best in the exhibition of 1846. With "Elgiva," a work\r\nexhibited in 1847, this first period, in which he followed the lines of\r\nthe now forgotten painter Hilton, was brought to an end. His next work,\r\n"Lorenzo and Isabella," now in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, bore\r\nthe letters P.R.B., as a sign of his new confession of faith.\r\nMicroscopically exact work in detail has taken the place of the large\r\nbravura and the empty imitation of the Cinquecentisti. The theme was\r\nborrowed from one of Boccaccio\'s tales, _The Pot of Basil_--the tale on\r\nwhich Keats founded _Isabella_. A company of Florentines in the costume\r\nof the thirteenth century are assembled at dinner. Lorenzo, pale and in\r\nsuppressed excitement, sits beside the lovely Isabella, looking at her\r\nwith a glance of deep, consuming passion. Isabella\'s brother, angered at\r\nit, gives a kick to her dog. All the persons at the table are\r\nlikenesses. The critic F. G. Stephens sat for the beloved of Isabella,\r\nand Dante Gabriel Rossetti for the toper holding his glass to his lips\r\nat the far right of the table. Even the ornaments upon the damask cloth,\r\nthe screen, and the tapestry in the background are painted, stroke after\r\nstroke, with the conscientious devotion of a primitive painter. Jan van\r\nEyck\'s brilliancy of colour is united to Perugino\'s suavity of feeling,\r\nand the chivalrous spirit of the _Decameron_ seized with the sureness of\r\na subtle literary scholar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  MILLAIS.   THE YEOMAN OF THE GUARD.]\r\n\r\nThe work of 1850, "The Child Jesus in the Workshop of Joseph the\r\nCarpenter," illustrated a verse in the Bible (Zechariah xiii. 6): "And\r\none shall say unto Him, What are these wounds in Thine hands? Then He\r\nshall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of My\r\nfriends." The Child Jesus, who is standing before the joiner\'s bench,\r\nhas hurt Himself in the hand. St. Joseph is leaning over to look at the\r\nwound, and Mary is kneeling beside the Child, trying to console Him\r\nwith her caresses, whilst the little St. John is bringing water in a\r\nwooden vessel. Upon the other side of the bench stands the aged Anna, in\r\nthe act of drawing out of the wood the nail which has caused the injury.\r\nA workman is labouring busily at the joiner\'s bench. The floor of the\r\nworkshop is littered with shavings, and tools hang round upon the walls.\r\nThe Quattrocentisti were likewise the determining influence in the\r\ntreatment of this subject. Ascetic austerity has taken the place of\r\nideal draperies, and angularity that of the noble flow of line. The\r\nfigure of Mary, who, with her yellow kerchief, resembled the wife of a\r\nLondon citizen, was the cause of special offence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mag. of Art._\r\n\r\n  MILLAIS.   THE RIGHT HON. W. E. GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Thomas Agnew & Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  MILLAIS.   YES OR NO?]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  MILLAIS.   MRS. BISCHOFFSHEIM.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mrs. Bischoffsheim, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nUp to the seventies Millais continued to paint such pictures out of the\r\nBible, or from English and medi\xc3\xa6val poets, with varying success. One of\r\nthem, which in its brilliant colouring looked like an old picture upon\r\nglass, represented the return of the dove to Noah\'s ark. The central\r\npoint was formed by two slender young women in medi\xc3\xa6val costume, who\r\nreceived the exhausted bird in their delicate hands. The picture, "The\r\nWoodman\'s Daughter," was an illustration to a poem by Coventry Patmore,\r\non the love of a young noble for a poor child of the wood. In a\r\nsemicircular picture of 1852 he painted Ophelia as she floats singing in\r\nthe green pool where the white water-lilies cover her like mortuary\r\nwreaths--floats with her parted lips flickering with a gentle smile of\r\ndistraction. The other picture of this year, "The Huguenot," represented\r\ntwo lovers taking leave of each other in an old park upon the eve of St.\r\nBartholomew. She is winding a white scarf round his arm to save him from\r\ndeath by this badge of the Catholics, whilst he is gently resisting. The\r\nmood of the man standing before the dark gate of death, the moral\r\nstrength which vanquishes his fear, and all the solemnity of his\r\nfarewell to life are expressed in his glance. A world of love rests in\r\nthe eyes of the woman. Millais has often treated this problem of the\r\nloving woman with earnest and almost sombre realism, that knows no touch\r\nof swooning sentimentality. "The Order of Release" of 1853 shows a\r\njailor in the scarlet uniform of the eighteenth century opening a heavy\r\nprison door to set at liberty a Highlander, whose release has been\r\nobtained by his wife. A scene from the seventeenth century is treated in\r\n"The Proscribed Royalist": a noble cavalier, hidden in a hollow tree, is\r\nkissing the hand of a graceful, trembling woman, who has been daily\r\nbringing him food at the risk of her life. "The Black Brunswicker" of\r\n1856 closed this series of silent and motionless dramas. In the picture\r\nof 1857, "Sir Isumbras at the Ford," an old knight is riding home\r\nthrough the twilight of a sultry day in June. The dust of the journey\r\nlies upon his golden armour. At a ford he has fallen in with two\r\nchildren, and has lifted them up to carry them over the water. And "The\r\nVale of Rest," a picture deep and intense in its scheme of colour,\r\nearnest and melancholy as a requiem, revealed--with a sentiment a little\r\nlike that of Lessing--a cloister garden where two nuns are silently\r\npreparing a grave in the evening light; while "The Eve of Saint Agnes"\r\nin 1863 illustrated the same poem of Keats to which ten years previously\r\nHolman Hunt had devoted his work of early years. Madeleine has heard the\r\nold legend, telling how girls receive the tender homage of their future\r\nhusbands if they go through their evening prayer supperless at midnight.\r\nWith her heart filled with the thoughts of love she quits the hall where\r\nthe guests are seated at a merry feast, and mounts to her room so\r\nhastily that her thin taper is extinguished on the way. She enters her\r\nlittle chamber, kneels down, repeats the prayer, and rises to her feet,\r\ntaking off her finery and loosening her hair. The clear moonlight\r\nstreams through the window, throwing a ghostly illumination over the\r\nlittle images of saints in the room, falling like a caress upon the\r\ntender young breast of the girl, playing upon her folded hands, and\r\ntouching her long, fair hair with a radiance like a vaporous glory. In\r\nthe shadow of the bed she sees him whom she loves. Motionless, as in a\r\ndream, she stands, nor ventures to turn lest the fair vision should\r\nvanish. "The Deliverance of a Heretic condemned to the Stake," "Joan of\r\nArc," "Cinderella," "The Last Rose," that dreamy picture of romantic\r\ngrace, "The Childhood of Sir Walter Raleigh," and the picture of the\r\nhoary Moses, supported by Hur and Aaron, watching from the mountain-top\r\nthe victory of Joshua, were the principal works achieved in the later\r\nyears of the master. But when these pictures were executed England had\r\nbecome accustomed to honour Millais, not as a pre-Raphaelite, but as her\r\ngreatest portrait painter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILLAIS.   THOMAS CARLYLE.]\r\n\r\nHis portrait of himself explains this transformation. With his white\r\nlinen jacket and his fresh sunburnt face Sir John Millais does not look\r\nin the least like a "Romanticist," scarcely like a painter; he has\r\nrather the air of being a wealthy landowner. He was a man of a sound and\r\nstraightforward nature, a great and energetic master, conscious of his\r\naim, but a poet in Ruskin\'s sense of the word is what he has never been.\r\nHis pre-Raphaelitism was only a flirtation. His methods of thought were\r\ntoo concrete, his hand too powerful, for him to have lingered always in\r\nthe world of the English poets, or endured the precise style of the\r\npre-Raphaelites. "Millais will \'go far\' if he will only change his\r\nboots," About had written on the occasion of the World Exhibition of\r\n1855; when that of 1867 was opened Millais appeared in absolutely new\r\nshoes. The great exhibition of 1857 in Manchester, which made known for\r\nthe first time how many of the works of Velasquez were hidden in English\r\nprivate collections, had helped Millais to the knowledge of himself.\r\nFrom the naturalism of the Quattrocentisti he made a transition to the\r\nnaturalism of Velasquez.\r\n\r\nMillais was a born portrait painter. His cool and yet finely sensitive\r\nnature, his simple, manly temperament, directed him to this department,\r\nwhich rather gravitates to the observant and imitative than to the\r\ncreative pole of art. In his pictures he has the secret of enchanting\r\nand of repelling; he has arrived at really definite issues in portrait\r\npainting. His likenesses are all of them as convincing as they are\r\nactual. Together with the Venetians and with Velasquez, Millais belongs\r\nto the master spirits of the grand style, which relies upon the large\r\nmovement of lines, in figure and in face, upon the broad foundation of\r\nsurfaces, and the strict subordination of individual details. His\r\nfigures are characteristic and recognisable even in outline. He makes no\r\neffort to render them interesting by picturesque attitudes, or to vivify\r\nthem by placing them in any situation. There they stand calm, and\r\nsometimes stiff and cold; they make no attempt at conversation with the\r\nspectator, nor come out of themselves, as it were, but fix their eyes\r\nupon him with an air of well-bred composure and indifference. Even the\r\nhands are not made use of for characterisation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  MILLAIS.   THE VALE OF REST.]\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary intensity of life which sparkles in his great figures,\r\nso simply displayed, is almost exclusively concentrated in the heads.\r\nMillais is perhaps the first master of characterisation amongst the\r\nmoderns. To bold and powerful exposition there is united a noble and\r\npsychical gaze. The eyes which he paints are like windows through which\r\nthe soul is visible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mag. of Art._\r\n\r\n  FORD MADOX BROWN.   THE LAST OF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nAmongst his portraits of men, those of Gladstone and Hook stand in the\r\nfirst rank: as paintings perhaps they are not specially eminent; both\r\nhave an opaque, sooty tone, from which Millais\' works not unfrequently\r\nsuffer, but as a definition of complex personalities they are comparable\r\nonly with the best pictures of Lenbach. How firmly does the statesman\r\nhold himself, despite his age, the old tree-feller, the stern idealist,\r\na genuine English figure chiselled out of hard wood. The play of light\r\ncentres all the interest on the fine, earnest, and puckered features,\r\nthe lofty forehead, the energetic chin, and the liquid, thoughtful eyes.\r\nAll the biography of Gladstone lies in this picture, which is simpler\r\nand greater in intuition than that which Lenbach painted of him. Hook,\r\nwith his broad face, furrowed with wrinkles, looks like an apostle or a\r\nfisher. Millais has looked into the heart of this man, who has in him\r\nsomething rugged and faithful, massive and tender; the painter of\r\nvigorous fishermen and vaporous sunbeams. Hook\'s landscapes have a\r\nforceful, earnest, and well-nigh religious effect, and something\r\npatriarchal and biblical lies in his gentle, reflective, and\r\ncontemplative glance.\r\n\r\nIn his portrait of the Duke of Westminster, painted in 1878, Millais\r\ndepicts him in hunting dress, red coat, white corduroys, and high,\r\nflexible boots, as he stands and buttons on his glove. The same year\r\n"The Yeoman of the Guard" was exhibited in Paris--the old type of\r\ndiscipline and loyalty, who sits there in his deep red uniform, with\r\nfeatures cast in bronze, like a Velasquez of 1878. Disraeli, Cardinal\r\nNewman, John Bright, Lord Salisbury, Charles Waring, Sir Henry Irving,\r\nthe Marquis of Lorne, and Simon Fraser are all worthy descendants of the\r\neminent men whom Reynolds painted a century before. The plastic effect\r\nof the figures is increased by the vacant, neutral ground of the\r\npicture. Like Velasquez, Millais has made use of every possible\r\nbackground, from the simplest, from the nullity of an almost black or\r\nbright surface, to richly furnished rooms and views of landscape.\r\nSometimes it is only indicated by a plain chair or table that the figure\r\nis standing in a room, or a heavy crimson curtain falls to serve as a\r\n_repoussoir_ for the head. With a noble abstention he avoids prettiness\r\nof line and insipid motives, and remains true to this virile taste even\r\nin his portraits of women. His women have curiously little of the\r\n\xc3\xa6sthetical trait which runs elsewhere through English portraits of\r\nladies. Millais renders them--as in the picture "Dummy Whist"--neither\r\nsweet nor tender, gives them nothing arch, sprightly, nor triumphant.\r\nSevere and sculptural in their mien, and full of character rather than\r\nbeauty, proud in bearing and upright in pose, their serious, energetic\r\nfeatures betray decision of character; and the glance of their brown\r\neyes--eyes like Juno\'s--is indifferent and almost hard. A straight and\r\nliberal forehead, a beautifully formed and very determined mouth, and a\r\nfull, round chin complete this impression of earnest dignity, august\r\nmajesty, and chilling pride. To this regular avoidance of every trace of\r\navailable charm there is joined a strict taste in toilette. He prefers\r\nto work with dark or subdued contrasts of colour, and he is also fond of\r\nlarge-flowered silks--black with citron-yellow and black with dark red.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mag. of Art._\r\n\r\n  FORD MADOX BROWN.   WORK.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nAnd this same stringent painter of character commands, as few others,\r\nthe soft light brush of a painter of children. No one since Reynolds and\r\nGainsborough has painted with so much character as Millais the dazzling\r\nfreshness of English youth; the energetic pose of a boy\'s head or the\r\nbeauty of an English girl--a thing which stands in the world alone: the\r\nsoft, glancing, silken locks, rippling to a _blonde cendr\xc3\xa9e_, pale,\r\ndelicate little faces, pouting little mouths, and great, shining blue,\r\ndreamy, childish eyes. Sometimes they stand in rose-coloured dresses\r\nembroidered with silver in front of a deep green curtain, or sit reading\r\nupon a dark red carpet flowered with black. At other times they are\r\narrayed like the little Infantas of Velasquez, and play with a spaniel\r\nlike the Doge\'s children of Titian, or hold out with both hands an apron\r\nfull of flowers, which Millais paints with a high degree of finish. A\r\nspray of pale red roses, chrysanthemums, or lilies stands near. One must\r\nbe a great master of characterisation to paint conscious, dignified, and\r\nearnest feminine beauty like that of Mrs. Bischoffsheim, and at the same\r\ntime that fragrant perfume of the fresh and dewy spring of youth which\r\nbreathes from Millais\' pictures of children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILLIP.   THE LETTER-WRITER, SEVILLE.]\r\n\r\nMillais is one of those men in the history of nineteenth-century\r\npainting who are as forcible and healthy as they are many-sided. I do\r\nnot know one who could have developed so swiftly from a style of the\r\nmost minute exactness to one of the most powerful breadth; not one who\r\ncould have united such poetry of conception with such an enormous\r\nknowledge of human beings; not one who could have been so like Proteus\r\nin variety--at one moment charming, at another dreamy, at another\r\nentirely positive. In their firm structure and largeness of manner his\r\nlandscapes sometimes recall Th\xc3\xa9odore Rousseau. And now the\r\npre-Raphaelite is just a little evident in an excess of detail. He\r\npaints every blade of grass and every small plant, though there is at\r\nthe same time a largeness in the midst of this scrupulous exactitude. He\r\ndoes not merely see the isolated fact through a magnifying lens, but has\r\neyes that are sensitive to the poetry of the whole, and in spite of all\r\nstudy of detail he sometimes reaches a total effect which is altogether\r\nimpressionist. His picture "Chill October" has an airy life, a grey,\r\nvibrating atmosphere, such as only John Constable painted elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSuch a concrete study of nature as was made by the pre-Raphaelites of\r\nnecessity led at last to entirely realistic pictures from modern life.\r\nIn their biblical and poetic pictures they had started from the\r\nconviction that new life-blood could only be poured into the old\r\nconventional types, which had gradually become meaningless by tactfully\r\ndrawing the models for them from popular life. They believed, as the\r\nmasters of Florence and Bruges had done before them, that there could be\r\nno good painting without strict dependence on the model; that it was of\r\nthe utmost importance to give a poetic or legendary figure the stamp of\r\nnature, the strong savour of individuality. All their creations are\r\nbased upon the elements of portrait painting, even when they illustrate\r\nremote scenes from the New Testament or from medi\xc3\xa6val poetry. And these\r\nelements at last led them altogether to give up transposing such figures\r\ninto an alien _milieu_, and simply to paint what was offered by their\r\nown surroundings. In this way they reached the goal which was arrived at\r\nin French painting through Courbet and Ribot. It is due in the first\r\nplace to the pre-Raphaelites that the well-meant and moderately painted\r\n_genre_ picture of the old style, which, with its wealth of pathetic\r\nstories, was once a prime source of supposed artistic pleasure, was\r\nfinally vanquished in England, and made way for earnest and vigorous\r\npainting,--painting which sought to make its effect by purely artistic\r\nmeans, and proudly declined attempt to conceal intrinsic weakness in\r\n"interesting" subject drawn from external sources. As early as 1855\r\nMillais exhibited a picture in the Royal Academy which Ruskin called a\r\ntruly great work containing the elements of immortality--"The Rescue."\r\nIt represented a fireman who has carried three children from a burning\r\nhouse and laid them in the arms of their parents. Narrative purport was\r\nentirely renounced. The fireman was treated without sentimentality, and\r\nin a way that suggested the cool fulfilment of a duty, and the agitation\r\nof the parents was also rendered without any dash of melodrama. Then\r\nthere followed that masterpiece of exquisite and soft colouring, tender\r\nand moving expression, and infinite grace, "The Gambler\'s Wife," sadly\r\ntaking up the cards which have brought her misery upon her. In 1874 was\r\npainted "The North-West Passage," a sort of modern symbol of the\r\nforceful, enterprising English people who have populated and subdued\r\nhalf the world from their little island kingdom. "There is a passage to\r\nthe Pole, and England will find it--must find it." These are more or\r\nless the words spoken by Trelawney, the old friend and comrade of Byron\r\nin Greece. With a chart before him he is brooding over the plan of the\r\nNorth-West Passage, and upon his own outstretched hand, which would fain\r\nhold the future in its grasp, the hand of a youthful woman is soothingly\r\nlaid, as she sits at his feet reading to him the narrative of the last\r\nvoyage of discovery. The figure of the seaman with his white beard has\r\na strong, sinewy life, and the broad daylight streams through the room,\r\nfilled with charts and atlases. The sea and clear, bright sky gleam\r\nthrough the open window. It is a powerful and moving picture, one of\r\nthose modern creations in which the ideas of the nineteenth century are\r\nconcentrated with simplicity and a renunciation of all hollow emphasis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILLIP.   SPANISH SISTERS.]\r\n\r\nA few pictures of modern life which have nothing in common with the\r\nolder _genre_ painting may even be found among the works of the\r\ndevotionalist Holman Hunt. "Awakened Conscience," according to the\r\nexplanation of the painter, tells the story of a young woman seduced by\r\na cruel and light-minded man, and kept in a luxurious little\r\ncountry-house. They are together. Seated at the piano he is playing the\r\nold melody "Oft in the Stilly Night," and the strains of the song recall\r\nto the frail maiden her youth, and the years of purity and innocence.\r\nThus even Hunt has not overcome the moralising tendencies of Hogarth,\r\nthough his taste is more discreet and delicate. He has struck deeper\r\nchords of thought than the English public had heard before. And in\r\nparticular the painting is not a mere substratum for the story; it has\r\nbecome the principal thing, and the story subsidiary. In another\r\npicture, "May Morning on Magdalen Tower," he renounced all deeper\r\npurpose altogether, and merely painted a number of Oxford dons and\r\nstudents, who, in accordance with the old custom, usher in the May with\r\na hymn from the college tower.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable work of this description has been executed by\r\nMadox Brown, the English Menzel, who has not merely reconstructed the\r\nenvironment of past ages with the accuracy of an eye-witness, but has\r\nlooked upon the drama of modern life as an attentive observer. His first\r\npicture, "The Last of England," was executed in the June of 1852, at a\r\ntime when emigration to America began to take serious proportions. A\r\nmarried couple, humble, middle-class people, are sitting on the deck of\r\na ship. The man, in his thick cloth overcoat, with a soft felt hat on\r\nhis head, a pale face, and sunken eyes with dark rings underneath, casts\r\none more look upon his native-land, which vanishes in the hazy distance,\r\nas he thinks bitterly of lost hopes and vain struggles. But the young\r\nwife, in a light-coloured cloak and a pretty round bonnet with wide\r\nstrings, gazes before her with gentle resignation, from underneath a\r\ngreat umbrella protecting her from the boisterous sea-wind.\r\n\r\nIn "Work," begun at the same period, and finished, after various\r\ninterruptions, in 1865, he has produced the first modern picture of\r\nartisans after Courbet\'s "Stone-breakers." The painter, who was then\r\nliving in Hampstead, where extensive cuttings were being made for the\r\nlaying down of gas-pipes, daily saw the English artisan at labour in all\r\nhis thick-set strength. This gave him the theme for his picture. In\r\nbright daylight on a glaring summer afternoon artisans are digging a\r\ntrench for gas-pipes in a busy street. Women and poor children are\r\nstanding near. Even the older _genre_ artists had painted men in their\r\nworking blouses, but only joking and making merry, never at work. Like\r\nstage-managers who are sure of their public, they always set the same\r\ntroop of puppets dancing. Madox Brown\'s artisans are robust and\r\nraw-boned figures; where the older artists affected to be witty with\r\ntheir _genre_ painting, Madox Brown painted straightforwardly, without\r\nhumour and without making his figures beautiful. The composition of his\r\npictures is just as plain. No one poses, no one makes impassioned\r\ngestures, no one thinks of grouping himself with his neighbour in fine\r\nflowing lines. It is pleasant to think that this powerful symbol of work\r\nhas passed by presentation into the possession of one of the greatest\r\nmanufacturing towns in England, into the gallery of Manchester.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. ANSDELL.   A SETTER AND GROUSE.]\r\n\r\nA Scotchman, born in Aberdeen, _John Phillip_ was the vigorous abettor\r\nof the pre-Raphaelites in these realistic endeavours. He, too, was a\r\npainter in the full meaning of the word, and he has therefore left works\r\nwith which the future will have to reckon. Velasquez had opened his eyes\r\nas he had opened those of Millais. When Phillip went to Spain in 1851,\r\nhe was not the first who had trod the Museo del Prado. Wilkie had\r\npainted in Spain before him, and Ansdell had been busy there at the same\r\ntime. But no one had been able to grasp in any degree the impressive\r\nmajesty of the old Spanish painters. John Phillip alone gained something\r\nof the _verve_ of Velasquez, a broad, virile technique which\r\ndistinguishes him from all his English contemporaries. The impression\r\nreceived from his pictures is one of opulence, depth, and weight; they\r\nunite something of the strength of Velasquez to a more Venetian\r\nsplendour of colour. The streets of Seville, the Spanish port on the\r\nGuadalquivir, the town where Velasquez and Murillo were born, were his\r\nchief field of study. Here he saw those market-women, black as mulattoes\r\nand sturdy as grenadiers, who sit in front of their fruit-baskets under\r\na great umbrella, and those water-carriers with sunburnt visages,\r\nstrongly built chests, and athletic arms.\r\n\r\nAfter he had returned to Scotland he occasionally painted pictures of\r\nceremonies, "The House of Commons," "The Wedding of the Princess\r\nRoyal," and so forth, but he soon returned to subjects from Spanish\r\nlife. Gipsy-looking, cigarette-smoking women, with sparkling eyes and\r\njet-black hair, young folks dancing to the castanets, bull-fighters with\r\nglittering silver-grey costume and flashing glances, dark-brown peasants\r\nin citron-yellow petticoats, hollow-eyed manufactory girls, potters, and\r\nglass-blowers.--such are the materials of Phillip\'s pictures. They give\r\nno scope to anecdote; but they always reveal a fragment of reality which\r\nemits a world of impressions and an opulence of artistic ability. As\r\npainter _par excellence_, John Phillip stands in opposition to older\r\nEnglish _genre_ painters. Whilst they were, in the first place, at pains\r\nto tell a story intelligibly, Phillip was a colourist, a _ma\xc3\xaetre\r\npeintre_, whose figures were developed from the colours, and whose\r\ncreations are so full of character that they will always assert their\r\nplace with the best that has ever been painted. Even in England, the\r\ncountry of literary and narrative painting, art was no longer an\r\ninstrument for expressing ideas; it had become an end in itself, and had\r\ndiscovered colour as its prime and most essential medium of expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nREALISM IN GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Germany the realistic movement was carried out in much the same way\r\nas in France, though it came into action two decades after its French\r\noriginal. Here also it was recognised that the well-meant but badly\r\npainted anecdote must give way to the well-painted picture: and if we\r\ninquire who it was that gave to Germany the first serious paintings\r\ninspired by the modern spirit the reply, without hesitation, must be\r\nAdolf Menzel. The pioneering work of this great little man, who for\r\nfifty years had embodied in their typical perfection all phases of\r\nGerman art, is something fabulous: the greatest and, one might almost\r\nsay, the only historical painter of bygone epochs, the only one who knew\r\na previous period so intimately that he could venture on painting it,\r\nwas also the leader of the great movement which, in the seventies, aimed\r\nat the representation of our own life. His first appearance was in the\r\ntime when the proud Titan Cornelius sought to take heaven by storm.\r\nLittle Menzel was no Titan in those days; he seems in that generation\r\nlike one bound to the earth, yet he belonged to the Cyclopean race. He\r\nwas a mighty architect with the powers of a giant; and this uncouth\r\nCyclops rough-hewed and chiselled the blocks, and, fitting each in its\r\nplace, raised an edifice to as lofty a height as the Romanticists had\r\nreached on the perilous wings of Icarus. Having been first the\r\ndraughtsman and then the painter of Frederick the Great, he gave up\r\nhistory after finishing the picture of the Battle of Hochkirch: his\r\ntalent was too modern, too much set upon what was concrete, to admit of\r\nits being given full scope to the end by constructive work from a\r\n_milieu_ that was not his own. Until his fortieth year he had celebrated\r\nthe glorious past of his country. When, with the death of Friedrich\r\nWilhelm IV, a great and decisive turn was given to the politics of the\r\nPrussian state--one which put an end to the stagnation of civil life in\r\nPrussia and Germany, and ushered in a new and brilliant period for the\r\nrealm and the heirs of Friedrich--the painter of Friedrich the Great\r\nbecame the painter of the new realm. After he had already, in the first\r\nhalf of the century, placed reality on the throne of art in the place of\r\nrhetoric and a vague ideal, he went one step further in the direction of\r\nkeen and direct observation, and now painted what he saw around him--the\r\nstream of palpitating life.\r\n\r\n"The Coronation of King Wilhelm at K\xc3\xb6nigsberg" is the great and\r\ntriumphant title-page to this section of his art. The effects of light,\r\nthe red tones of the uniforms, the shimmering white silk dresses, the\r\nsurging of the mass of people, the perfect ease with which all the\r\npersonages are individualised, the princes, the ministers, the\r\nambassadors, the men of learning, the instantaneousness in the movement\r\nof the figures, the absolutely unforced and yet subtle and pictorial\r\ncomposition, render this painting no picture of ceremonies, in the\r\ntraditional sense of the phrase, but a work of art at once intimate and\r\naugust in the impression which it makes. In the picture "King Wilhelm\r\nsetting out to join the Army"--the representation of the thrilling\r\nmoment, on the afternoon of 31st July 1870, when the King drove along\r\nthe linden avenue to the railway station--this phase, which he began\r\nwith the Coronation picture, was brought to a close. Everything surges\r\nand moves, speaks and breathes, and glows with the palpitating life\r\nwhich vibrates through all in this moment of patriotic excitement. But\r\nthe painter\'s course led him further.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADOLF MENZEL.]\r\n\r\nHe first became entirely Menzel when he made the discovery of toiling\r\nhumanity. In 1867, in the year of the World Exhibition, he came to Paris\r\nand became acquainted with Meissonier and Stevens. With Meissonier in\r\nparticular--whose portrait he painted--he entered into a close\r\nfriendship, and it was curious afterwards to see the two together at\r\nexhibitions--the little figure of Menzel with his gigantic bald forehead\r\nand the little figure of Meissonier with his gigantic beard, a Cyclops\r\nand a Gnome, two kings in the realm of Liliput, of whom one was unable\r\nto speak a word of German and the other unable to speak a word of\r\nFrench, although they had need merely of a look, a shrug, or a movement\r\nof the hand to understand each other entirely. He also came into the\r\nsociety of Courbet, who had just made the famous separate exhibition of\r\nhis works, at the Caf\xc3\xa9 Lamartine, in the company of Heilbuth, Meyerheim,\r\nKnaus, and others. Here in Paris he produced his first pictures of\r\npopular contemporary life, and if as an historical painter he had\r\nalready been a leader in the struggle against theatrical art, he became\r\na pioneer in these works also. Everywhere he let in air and made free\r\nmovement possible for those who pressed forward in his steps. In the\r\ncourse of years he painted and drew everything which excited in him\r\nartistic impulse upon any ground whatever, and not one of these\r\nendeavours was work thrown away. A universal genius amongst the painters\r\nof real life, he combined all the qualities of which other men of\r\nexcellent talent merely possessed fragments separately apportioned\r\namongst them: the sharpest eye for every detail of form, the most\r\npenetrative discrimination for the life of the spirit, and at times a\r\nglistening play of colour possessed by none of his German predecessors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MENZEL.   FROM KUGLER\'S "HISTORY OF FRIEDRICH THE GREAT."]\r\n\r\nCatholic churches seem always to have had a great attraction for him, as\r\nwell as the people moving in them, and in this an echo of his _rococo_\r\nenthusiasm is still perceptible. The quaint, _rococo_ churches in the\r\nornate style favoured by the Jesuits, which are still preserved intact\r\nin Munich and the Tyrol, were those for which he had a peculiar\r\npreference. He lost himself voluptuously in the thousand details of\r\nsculpture, framework, organs, balustrades, and carved pulpits, dimly\r\noutlined in the subdued light from stained-glass windows. In the gloom\r\nit was all transformed into a forest of ornaments, expanding their\r\ntraceries like trees in a wood. Sick and infirm people, women in prayer\r\nburying their faces in their hands, and lame men with crutches, kneel or\r\nmove amid the luxuriant efflorescence of stone and wood and gold, of\r\nangels\' heads and shrines, garlands of flowers, consoles, and fonts of\r\nholy water. Twisted marble pillars, church banners, lamps and lustres\r\nmount in a confusion of capricious outlines at once tasteful and piquant\r\nto the vaulted dome, where the painted skies, blackened by the\r\nascending mist of incense, seem waywardly fantastic.\r\n\r\nAfter the churches the salons appealed to him. There came his pictures\r\nof modern society: ladies and cavaliers of the Court upon ballroom\r\nbalconies, the conversation of Privy Councillors in the salon, the\r\nmarvellous ball supper, where a mass of beautiful shoulders, splendid\r\nuniforms, and rustling silken trains move amid mirrors, lustres,\r\ncolonnades, and gilded frames. "The Ball Supper" of 1870 is a vivid\r\npicture, bathed in glistening light. The music has stopped. And from a\r\ndoor of the brilliantly lighted ballroom the company is streaming into\r\nthe neighbouring apartment, where the supper-table has been laid, and\r\ngroups of ladies and men in animated conversation are beginning to\r\noccupy the chairs and sofas. In 1879 there followed the famous "Levee":\r\nthe Emperor Wilhelm in the red Court uniform of the _Gardes du Corps_ is\r\ntalking with a lady, surrounded by a sea of heads, uniforms, and naked\r\nbowing shoulders. Though it was always necessary in earlier\r\nrepresentations of the kind to have a _genre_ episode to compensate the\r\ninsufficient artistic interest of the work, in Menzel\'s pictures the\r\npictorial situation is grasped as a whole. They have the value of a\r\nbook; they neither falsify nor beautify anything, and they will hand\r\ndown to the future an encyclop\xc3\xa6dia of types of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nFrom the salon he went to the street, from exclusive aristocratic\r\ncircles into the midst of the eddying crowd. For many years in\r\nsuccession Menzel was a constant visitor at the small watering-places in\r\nthe Austrian and Bavarian Alps. The multitude of people at the concerts,\r\nin the garden of the restaurant, on the promenade, at the open-air\r\nservices, were precisely the things to occupy his brush. The light\r\nrippled through the leaves of the trees; women, children, and well-bred\r\nmen of the world listened to the music or the words of the preacher. One\r\nperson leaves a seat and another takes it; everything lives and moves.\r\nHuge and lofty trees stretch out their arms, protecting the company from\r\nthe sun. Unusually striking was "The Procession in Gastein": in the\r\ncentre was the priest bearing the Host, then the choristers in their red\r\nrobes, in front the visitors and tourists who had hastened to see the\r\nspectacle, and in the background the mountain heights. The bustle of\r\npeople gives Menzel the opportunity for a triumph. In Kissingen he\r\npainted the promenade at the waters; in Paris the Sunday gaiety in the\r\ngarden of the Tuileries, the street life upon the boulevard, the famous\r\nscene in the _Jardin des Plantes_, with the great elephants and the\r\nvivid group of Zouaves and ladies; in Verona the Piazza d\'Erbe, with the\r\nswarm of people crowding in between the open booths and shouting at the\r\ntop of their voices. Many after him have represented such scenes,\r\nalthough few have had the secret of giving their figures such seething\r\nlife, or painting them, like Menzel, as parts of one great, surging, and\r\nmany-headed multitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  MENZEL.   THE CORONATION OF KING WILHELM I.]\r\n\r\nPeople travelling have always been for him a source of much amusement:\r\nmen sitting in the corner of a railway carriage with their legs crossed\r\nand their hats over their eyes, yawning or asleep; women looking out of\r\nthe windows or counting their ready money. Alternating with such themes\r\nare those monotonous yet simple and therefore genial landscapes from the\r\nsuburbs of the great city, poor, neglected regions with machines and men\r\nat their labour. Children bathing in a dirty stream bordered by little,\r\nstunted willows; small craft gliding over a river, sailors leaping from\r\none vessel to another, men landing sacks or barrels, and great, heavy\r\ncart-horses dragging huge waggons loaded with beer-barrels along the\r\ndusty country road. Or the scaffolding of a house is being raised. Six\r\nmasons are at work upon it, and they are working in earnest. A green\r\nbush waves (German fashion) above the scaffolding, and further off long\r\nrows of houses stretch away, and the aqueducts and gas-works which\r\nsupply the huge crater of Berlin, and day-labourers are seen wheeling up\r\nbarrow-loads of stones. For the first time a German painter sings the\r\ncanticle of labour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MENZEL.   FROM KUGLER\'S "HISTORY OF FRIEDRICH THE GREAT."]\r\n\r\nFrom the streets he enters the work-places, and interprets the wild\r\npoetry of roaring machines in smoky manufactories. The masterpiece of\r\nthis group is that bold and powerful picture, his "Iron Mill" of 1876.\r\nThe workshop of the great rail-forge of K\xc3\xb6nigsh\xc3\xbctte in Upper Silesia is\r\nfull of heat and steam. The muscular, brawny figures of men with glowing\r\nfaces stand at the furnace holding the tongs in their swollen hands.\r\nTheir vigorous gestures recall Daumier. Upon the upper part of their\r\nbodies, which is naked, the light casts white, blue, and dark red\r\nreflections, and over the lower part it flickers in reddish, greenish,\r\nand violet tinges, on the creases in their clothing. The smoke rising in\r\nspirals is of a whitish-red, and the beams supporting the roof are lit\r\nup with a sombre glow. Heat, sweat, movement, and the glare of fire are\r\neverywhere. Dust and dirt, strong, raw-boned iron-workers washing\r\nthemselves, or exhausted with hard toil, snatching a hasty meal, a\r\nconfusion of belting and machinery, no pretty anecdote but sober\r\nearnest, no story but pure painting--these were the great and decisive\r\nachievements of this picture. Courbet\'s "Stone-breakers" of 1851, Madox\r\nBrown\'s "Work" of 1852, and Menzel\'s "Iron Mill" are the standard works\r\nin the art of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  MENZEL.   THE DAMENSTIFTSKIRCHE AT MUNICH.]\r\n\r\nWithin German art Menzel has won an _enclave_ for himself, a rock amid\r\nthe sea. In France during the sixties he represented German art in\r\ngeneral. France offered him celebrity, and after this recognition he had\r\nthe fortune to be honoured in his native-land before he was overtaken by\r\nold age. His realism was permitted to him at a time when realistic aims\r\nwere elsewhere reckoned altogether as \xc3\xa6sthetic errors. This explains the\r\nremarkable fact that Menzel\'s toil of fifty years had scarcely any\r\ninfluence on the development of German painting; it would scarcely be\r\ndifferent from what it is now if he had never existed. When he might\r\nhave been an exemplar there was no one who dared to follow him. And\r\nlater, when German art as a whole had entered upon naturalistic lines,\r\nthe differences between him and the younger generation were more\r\nnumerous than their points of sympathy, so that it was impossible for\r\nhim to have a formative influence. He stood out in the new period merely\r\nas a power commanding respect, like a hero of ancient times. Even the\r\nisolated realistic onsets made in Berlin in the seventies are in no way\r\nto be connected with him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  MENZEL.   KING WILHELM SETTING OUT TO JOIN THE ARMY.]\r\n\r\nIf realism consisted in the dry and sober illustration of selected\r\nfragments of reality, if upright feeling, loyalty, and honest patriotism\r\nwere serviceable qualities in art, a lengthier consideration should\r\ncertainly be accorded to _Anton von Werner_. In his _genre_ pictures of\r\ncampaign life everything is spick and span, everything is in its right\r\nplace and in soldierly order: it is all typically Prussian art. His\r\nportraits are casino pictures, and as such it is impossible to imagine\r\nhow they could better serve their purpose. From the spurs to the\r\ncuirassier helmet everything is correct and in accordance with military\r\nregulation; even the likeness has something officially prescribed which\r\nwould make any recruit form front if suddenly brought face to face with\r\nsuch a person. In his pictures of ceremonies his ability was just\r\nsufficient to chronicle the function in question with the\r\nconscientiousness of a clerk in a law court. The intellectual capacity\r\nfor seeing more of a great man than his immaculately polished boots and\r\nthe immaculately burnished buttons of his uniform was denied him, as was\r\nthe artistic capacity of exalting a picture-sheet to the level of a\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a healthy though trivial feeling for reality, _Carl\r\nG\xc3\xbcssow_ ventured to approach nature in a sturdy and robust fashion in\r\nsome of his works, and exhibited in Berlin a few life-sized figures,\r\n"Pussy," "A Lover of Flowers," "Lost Happiness," "Welcome," "The Oyster\r\nGirl," and so forth. Through these he opened for a brief period in\r\nBerlin the era of yellow kerchiefs and black finger-nails, and on the\r\nstrength of them was exalted by the critics as a pioneer of realism or\r\nelse anathematised, according to their \xc3\xa6sthetic creed. He had a robust\r\nmethod of painting muscles and flesh and clothes of many colours, and of\r\nsetting green beside red and red beside yellow, yet even in these first\r\nworks--his only works of artistic merit--he never got beyond the banal\r\nand barbaric transcript of a reality which was entirely without\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n_Max Michael_ seems to be somewhat influenced by Bonvin. Like the\r\nlatter, he was attracted by the silent motions of nuns, juicy\r\nvegetables, dark-brown wainscoting, and the subdued light of interiors.\r\nHe was, like Ribot in France, although with less artistic power, a good\r\nrepresentative of that "school of cellar skylights" which imitated in a\r\nsound manner the tone of the old Spanish masters. One of his finest\r\npictures, which hangs in the Kunsthalle in Hamburg, represents a girls\'\r\nschool in Italy. A nun is presiding over the sewing-lesson; the\r\nbackground is brown; the light comes through the yellow glass of a high\r\nand small window (like that of an attic), and throws a brown dusky tone\r\nover the room, in which the gay costumes of the little Italian girls,\r\nwith their white kerchiefs, make exceedingly pretty and harmonious spots\r\nof colour. No adventure is hinted at, no episode related, but the\r\npicturesque appearance of the little girls, and their tones in the\r\nspace, are all the more delicately rendered. A refined scheme of colour\r\nrecalling the old masters compensates for the want of incident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  MENZEL.   THE IRON MILL.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Berlin Photographic Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  MENZEL.   SUNDAY IN THE TUILERIES GARDENS.]\r\n\r\nIn Vienna _August von Pettenkofen_ made a transition from the ossified,\r\nantediluvian _genre_ painting to painting which was artistically\r\ndelicate. While the successors of Gauermann and Danhauser indulged in\r\nheart-breaking scenes or humorous episodes, Pettenkofen was the first to\r\nobserve the world from a purely pictorial point of view. Alfred Stevens\r\nhad opened his eyes in Paris in 1851. Troyon\'s pictures and Millet\'s\r\nconfirmed him in his efforts. He was brought up on a property belonging\r\nto his father in Galicia, and had been a cavalry officer before he\r\nturned to painting: horses, peasants, and oxen are the simple figures of\r\nhis pictures. In the place of episodic, ill-painted stories he set the\r\nmeagre plains of lonely Pusta, sooty forges, gloomy cobblers\' work\r\nshops, dirty courtyards with middens and rubbish-heaps, gipsy\r\nencampments, and desolate garrets. There is no pandering to\r\nsentimentality or the curiosity excited by _genre_ painting. There are\r\ndelicate chords of colour, and that is enough. The artist was in the\r\nhabit of spending the summer months in the little town of Spolnok on the\r\nTheiss, to the east of Pesth. Here he wandered about amongst the little\r\nwhitewashed houses, the booths of general dealers, and the\r\nfruit-sellers\' stalls. A lazily moving yoke of oxen with a lad asleep,\r\ndark-eyed girls fetching water, poor children playing on the ground, old\r\nmen dreaming in the sun in a courtyard, are generally the only breathing\r\nbeings in his pictures. Here is a sandy village-square with low,\r\nwhite-washed houses; there is a wain with oxen standing in the street,\r\nor a postilion trotting away on his tired nag. Like Menzel, Pettenkofen\r\npaints busy humanity absorbed in their toil, simple beings who do not\r\ndream of leaving off work for the sake of those who frequent picture\r\ngalleries. What differentiates him from the Berlin painter is a more\r\nlyrical impulse, something tender, thoughtful, and contemplative. Menzel\r\ngives dramatic point to everything he touches; he sets masses in\r\nmovement, depicts a busy, noisy crowd, pressing together and elbowing\r\none another, forcing their way at the doors of theatres or the windows\r\nof caf\xc3\xa9s in a multifarious throng. Pettenkofen lingers with the petty\r\nartisan and the solitary sempstress. In Menzel\'s "Iron Mill" the sparks\r\nare flying and the machines whirring, but everything is peaceful and\r\nquiet in the cobblers\' workshops and the sunny attics visited by\r\nPettenkofen. Menzel delights in momentary impressions and quivering\r\nlife; Pettenkofen in rest and solitude. In the former every one is\r\nthinking and talking and on the alert; in the latter every one is\r\nyawning or asleep. If Menzel paints a waggon, the driver cracks his whip\r\nand one hears the team rattling over the uneven pavement; in Pettenkofen\r\nthe waggon stands quietly in a narrow lane, the driver enjoys a midday\r\nrest, and an enervating, sultry heat broods overhead. Menzel has a love\r\nfor men and women with excitement written on their faces; Pettenkofen\r\navoids painting character, contenting himself with the reproduction of\r\nsimple actions at picturesque moments. The Berlin artist is\r\nepigrammatically sharp; the Viennese is elegiac and melancholy. Menzel\'s\r\npictures have the changing glitter of rockets; those of Pettenkofen are\r\nharmonised in the tone of a refined amateur. They have only one thing in\r\ncommon: neither has found disciples; they are not culminating peaks in\r\nBerlin or Vienna art so much as boulders wedged into another system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  MENZEL.   A LEVEE.]\r\n\r\nWhilst the realistic movement in both towns was confined to particular\r\nmasters, Munich had once again the mission of becoming a guiding\r\ninfluence. Here all the tendencies of modern art have left the most\r\ndistinct traces, all movements were consummated with most consistency.\r\nThe heroes of Piloty followed the divinities of Cornelius, and these\r\nwere in turn succeeded by the Tyrolese peasants of Defregger, and amid\r\nall this difference of theme one bond connected these works: for\r\ninteresting subject was the matter of chief importance in them, and the\r\npurely pictorial element was something subordinate. The efforts of the\r\nseventies had for their object the victory of this pictorial element. It\r\nwas recognised that the talent for making humorous points and telling\r\nstories, which came in question as the determining quality in the\r\npictures of monks and peasants of the school of Defregger and Gr\xc3\xbctzner,\r\nwas the expression of no real faculty for formative art--that it was\r\nmerely technical incompleteness complacently supported by the lack of\r\nartistic sensibility in the public which had produced this narrative\r\npainting. It was felt that the task of formative art did not consist in\r\nnarrative, but in representation, and in representation through the most\r\nsensuous and convincing means which stood at its disposal. A renewed\r\nstudy of the old masters made this recognition possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G\xc3\x9cSSOW.   THE ARCHITECT.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. H. Salomonson, Esq., the owner of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nUp to this time the most miserable desolation had also reigned over the\r\nprovince of the artistic crafts. But, borne up by the rekindled\r\nsentiment of nationality, and favoured by the high tide of the milliards\r\npaid by France, since 1870, that eventful movement bearing the words\r\n"Old German" and "Fine Style" on its programme had become an\r\naccomplished fact. The German Renaissance, which research had been\r\nhitherto neglected, was discovered afresh. L\xc3\xbcbke explored it thoroughly\r\nand systematically; Woltmann wrote on Hans Holbein, Thausing on D\xc3\xbcrer;\r\nEitelberger founded the Austrian Industrial Museum; Georg Hirth brought\r\nout his _Deutsches Zimmer_, and began the publication of the\r\n_Formenschatz_. The national form of art of the German Renaissance was\r\ntaken up everywhere with a proud consciousness of patriotism: here, it\r\nwas thought, was a panacea. Those who followed the artistic crafts\r\ndeclared open war against everything pedestrian and tedious. _Lorenz\r\nGedon_ in particular--in union with Franz and Rudolf Seitz--was the soul\r\nof the movement. With his black, curly hair, his little, fiery, dark\r\neyes, his short beard, his negligent dress, and his two great hands\r\nexpert in the exercise of every description of art, he had himself\r\nsomething of the character of an old German stone-cutter. His manner of\r\nexpressing himself corresponded to this appearance. In every thing it\r\nwas original, saturated with his own personal conception of the world.\r\nAs the son of a dealer in old pictures and curiosities, he was familiar\r\nwith the old masters from his childhood, and followed them in the method\r\nof his study. He was far from confining himself to one branch. The\r\nfa\xc3\xa7ades of houses, the architecture of interiors, tavern rooms and\r\nfestal decorations, furniture and state carriages, statues and\r\nembellishments in stone, bronze, wood, and iron, portrait busts in wax,\r\nclay, and marble, models for ornaments, for iron lattices, for the\r\nadornment of ships and the fittings of cabins, all objects that were\r\nwayward, fantastic, quaint, and curious lay in his province; and for the\r\nexecution of each in turn this remarkable man felt that he had in him an\r\nequal capacity. And, at the same time, the temperament of a collector\r\nwas united in him with that of an artist in an entirely special way. In\r\nthe bushy wilderness of a garden before his house in the Nymphenburger\r\nStrasse countless stone fragments of medi\xc3\xa6val sculpture were strewn\r\nabout, up to the very hedge dividing it from the street. Rusty old\r\ntrellises of wrought iron slanted in front of the windows, and in the\r\nhouse itself the most precious objects, which artists ten years before\r\nhad passed without heed, stood in masses together. As Gedon was taken\r\nfrom his work when he was forty his artistic endeavour never got beyond\r\nefforts of improvisation, but the impulse which he gave was very\r\npowerful. Through his initiative the whole province of the artistic\r\ncrafts was brought under observation from a pictorial point of view. The\r\nbald Philistine style of decoration gave way and a blithe revel of\r\ncolour was begun. The great carnival feasts arranged by him on the model\r\nof the Renaissance period are an important episode in the history of\r\nculture in Munich, and have contributed in no unessential manner to the\r\nrefinement of taste in the toilette of women. The Munich Exhibition of\r\nthe Arts and Crafts in 1876 (before the entrance of which he had erected\r\nthat great portal made of old fragments of architecture, wood-carving,\r\nand splendid stuffs, and bearing the inscription "The Works of our\r\nFathers") indicated the zenith of that movement in the handicrafts which\r\nwas flooding all Germany in those days.\r\n\r\nThe course which was run by this movement in the following years is well\r\nknown, and it is well known how the imitation of the German Renaissance\r\nsoon became as wearisome as in the beginning it had been attractive.\r\nAfter it had been a little overdone another step was taken, and from the\r\nRenaissance people went to the _baroque_ period, and soon afterwards the\r\n_rococo_ period followed. In these days sobriety has taken the place of\r\nthis fever for ornamentation, and the mania for style has resulted in a\r\nsurfeit, a weariness and a desire for simplicity and quietude.\r\nNevertheless the beneficial influence of the movement on the general\r\nelevation of taste is undeniable, and indirectly it was of service to\r\npainting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seeman, Leipzig._   AUGUST VON PETTENKOFEN.]\r\n\r\nIn rooms where the owner was the only article of the inventory repugnant\r\nto the conception of style, only those pictures were admitted which had\r\nbeen executed in the exact manner of the old masters. Works of art were\r\nregarded as tasteful furniture, and were obliged to harmonise correctly\r\nwith the other appointments of the room; they had, moreover, to be\r\nthemselves legitimate "imitations of the Works of our Fathers." And, in\r\nthis way, the movement in the handicrafts gave an impulse to a renewed\r\nstudy of the old masters, carried out with far more refinement than had\r\nhitherto been the case. Amongst the costume painters spread over all\r\nGermany, the experts in costume, working in Munich during the seventies,\r\nform a really artistic race of able painters who were peculiarly\r\nsensitive to colour. They were the historians of art, the connoisseurs\r\nof colour in the ranks of the painters. Piloty did not satisfy them;\r\nthey buried themselves in the study of old masters with a delicately\r\nsensitive appreciation of them; they began to mix soft, luxuriant, and\r\nmelting colours upon their palettes, and to feel the peculiar joy of\r\npainting. Whilst they imitated the exquisite "little masters" of former\r\nages, in dimly lighted studios hung with Gobelins, imitating at the same\r\ntime the beautifying rust of centuries, they gradually abandoned all\r\ntheir own tricks of art; and whilst they devoted themselves to detail\r\nthey brought about the Renaissance of oil-painting. Compared with\r\nearlier works, their pictures are like rare dainties. They no longer\r\nrecognised the end of their calling, as the _genre_ painters had done,\r\nin a one-sided talent for characterisation, but tried once more to lay\r\nchief weight upon the pictorial and artistic appearance of their\r\npictures. They were conscious of a presentiment that there were higher\r\nspheres of art than the commonplace humour of _genre_ painting, and this\r\nrecognition had a very wide bearing. Pictorial point took the place of\r\nnarrative humour. If artists had previously painted thoughts they now\r\nbegan to paint things, and even if the things were bundles of straw,\r\nmedi\xc3\xa6val hose, and the old robes of cardinals, they were no longer\r\n"invented," but something which had been seen as a whole. It was a\r\ntransition towards ultimately painting what had actually taken place\r\nbefore the artist\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  PETTENKOFEN.   A WOMAN SPINNING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  PETTENKOFEN.   IN THE CONVENT YARD.]\r\n\r\nThat sumptuous, healthy artist of such pictorial ability, _Diez_, the\r\nVictor Scheffel of painting, stands at the head of the group. From his\r\nyouth upwards his chief place of resort had been the cabinet of\r\nengravings where he studied Schongauer, D\xc3\xbcrer, and Rembrandt, and all\r\nthe boon-companions and vagabonds etched or cut in copper or wood, and\r\non the model of these he painted his own marauders, robber-barons,\r\npeasants in revolt, old German weddings and fairs. His picture "To the\r\nChurch Consecration" recalls Beham, his "Merry Riding" Schongauer, and\r\nhis "Ambuscade" D\xc3\xbcrer, whilst Teniers served as model for his fairs.\r\nDiez knows the period from D\xc3\xbcrer and Holbein to Rubens, Rembrandt,\r\nWouwerman, and Brouwer as thoroughly as an historian of art, and\r\nsometimes--for instance in his "Picnic in the Forest"--he has even drawn\r\nthe eighteenth century into the circle of his studies. His pictures had\r\nan unrivalled delicacy of tone, and could certainly hang beside their\r\nDutch models in the Pinakothek without losing anything by such\r\nproximity.\r\n\r\nSomething of Brouwer or Ostade revived once more in _Harburger_, the\r\ntalented draughtsman of _Fliegende Bl\xc3\xa4tter_, the undisputed monarch\r\nof the kingdom of slouching hats, old mugs, and Delft pipes. Pictures\r\nlike "The Peasants\' Doctor," "The Card-players," "The Grandmother," "By\r\nthe Quiet Fireside," "In the Armchair," and "Easy-going Folk" were\r\nmasterpieces of delicate Dutch painting: the tone of his pictures shows\r\ndistinction and temperament; they have deep and fine _chiaroscuro_, and\r\nare soft and fluent in execution. _Loefftz_ with his picture "Love and\r\nAvarice" appeared as Quentin Matsys _redivivus_, and then attached\r\nhimself in turn to Holbein and Van Dyck; and exercised, like Diez, a\r\ngreat influence on the younger generation by his activity as a teacher.\r\n\r\n_Claus Meyer_, who became one of the best known amongst the young Munich\r\npainters by his "Sewing School in the Nunnery" of 1883, is worthy of\r\nremark inasmuch as he acquired a method of painting which was full of\r\n_nuances_, through modelling himself upon Pieter de Hoogh and Van der\r\nMeer of Delft. Through the windows hung with thin curtains the warm,\r\nquiet daylight falls into the room, glancing on the clean boards of the\r\nfloor, on the polished tops of the tables, the white pages of the books,\r\nand the blond and brown hair of the children, playing round it like a\r\ngolden nimbus. Another sunbeam streams through the door, which is not\r\nentirely closed, and quivers over the floor in a bright and narrow strip\r\nof light. The intimate representation of peaceful scenes of modest life,\r\nthe entirely pictorial representation of peaceful and congenial events,\r\nhas taken the place of the adventures dear to _genre_ painting. Old\r\ngentlemen with a glass of beer and a clay pipe, servant-girls peeling\r\npotatoes in the kitchen, pupils at the cloister sitting over their books\r\nin the library, drinkers, smokers, and dicers--such were the quiet,\r\npassive, and silent figures of his later pictures. The mild sunshine\r\nbreaks in and plays over them. Light clouds of tobacco smoke float in\r\nthe air. Everything is homely and pleasant, touched with a breath of\r\npictorial charm, comfortable warmth, and poetic fragrance. A hundred\r\nyears hence his works will be sold as flawlessly delicate and genuine\r\nold Dutch pictures. _Holmberg_ became the historian of cardinals. A\r\nwindow, consisting of rounded, clumpy panes, with little glass pictures\r\nlet in, forms the background of the room, and in the subdued oil-light\r\nwhich beams over splendid vessels and ornaments, chests and Gobelins,\r\nthe white satin dresses of ladies in the mode of 1640, or the lilac and\r\npurple robes of cardinals from the artist\'s rich wardrobe, are\r\ndisplayed, together with the appropriate models.\r\n\r\nIn _Fritz August Kaulbach_, the most versatile of the group in his\r\nadoption of various manners, the essence of this whole tendency is to be\r\nfound. He did not belong to the specialists who restricted themselves,\r\nin a one-sided fashion, to the imitation of the Flemish or the Dutch\r\nmasters, but appeared like old Diterici, Proteus-like, now in one and\r\nnow in another mask; and, whether he assumed the features of Holbein,\r\nCarlo Dolci, Van Dyck, or Watteau, he had the secret of being invariably\r\ngraceful and _chic_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  DIEZ.   RETURNING FROM MARKET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLAUS MEYER.   THE SMOKING PARTY.]\r\n\r\nWhen the German Renaissance was at its zenith he painted in the\r\nRenaissance style: harmless _genre_ pictures _\xc3\xa0 la_ Beyschlag--the joys\r\nof love and of the family circle--but not being so banal as the latter\r\nhe painted them with more delicate colouring and finer poetic charm.\r\nCertain single figures were found specially acceptable--for instance,\r\nthe daughters of Nuremberg patricians, and noble ladies in the old\r\nGerman caps, dark velvet gowns, and long plaits like Gretchen\'s, with\r\ntheir eyes sometimes uplifted and sometimes lowered, and their hands at\r\none moment folded and at another carrying a shining covered goblet.\r\nOccasionally these single figures were portraits, but none the less were\r\nthey transformed into "ladies in old German costume"; and Kaulbach\r\nunderstood how to paint, to the utmost satisfaction of his patrons, the\r\nblack caps, no less well than the little veil and the net of pearls, and\r\nthe greenish-yellow silk of the puffed sleeves, no less well than the\r\nplush border of the dark gown and the antique red Gretchen pocket. Many\r\nof them held a lute and stood amid a spring landscape, before a\r\nstreamlet, or a silver-birch, such as Stevens delighted in painting ten\r\nyears previously. At that time Fritz August Kaulbach, with greater\r\nsoftness in his treatment, occupied in Germany the place which Florent\r\nWillems had occupied in Belgium. Since then he has brought nearer to the\r\npublic the most various old and modern masters, and he has done so with\r\nfine artistic feeling: in his "May Day" he has revived the pastoral\r\nscenes of Watteau with a felicitous cleverness; in his "St. Cecilia" he\r\ncreated a total effect of great grace by going arm in arm with Carlo\r\nDolci and Gabriel Max; his "Piet\xc3\xa0" he composed with "the best figures of\r\nMichael Angelo, Fra Bartolommeo, and Titian," just as Gerard de Lairesse\r\nhad once recommended to painters. Intermediately he painted frail\r\nflower-like girls _\xc3\xa0 la_ Gabriel Max, charming little angels _\xc3\xa0 la_\r\nThoma, children in Pierrot costume _\xc3\xa0 la_ Vollon, and little landscapes\r\n_\xc3\xa0 la_ Gainsborough. He did not find in himself the plan for a new\r\nedifice in erecting his palace of art, but built according to any plans\r\nthat came in his way; he simply chose from all existing forms the most\r\ngraceful, the most elegant, the most precious, culled from their\r\nbeauties only the flowers, and bound them into a tasteful bouquet. In\r\nhis modern portraits of women, which in recent years have been his chief\r\nsuccesses, he placed himself between Van Dyck and the English. Of\r\ncourse, a really _chic_ painter of women, like Sargent, is not to be\r\nthought of in this connection; but for Germany these portraits were in\r\nexceedingly fine taste, had an interesting Kaulbachian trace of\r\nindifferent health, and breathed an _odeur de femme_ which found very\r\nwide approval. In his "Lieschen, the Waitress of the Shooting Festival"\r\nhe risked a fresh attempt at treating popular life, and made of it such\r\na graceful picture that it might almost have been painted by Piglhein;\r\nwhile in a series of spirited caricatures he even succeeded in\r\nbeing--Kaulbach. The history of art is wide, and since Fritz August\r\nKaulbach knows it extremely well, he will certainly find much to paint\r\nthat is pleasing and attractive, "_s\'il continue \xc3\xa0 laisser errer son\r\nimagination \xc3\xa0 travers les formes diverses cr\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa9es par l\'art de tous les\r\ntemps_," as the _Gazette des Beaux-Arts_ said of him on the occasion of\r\nthe Vienna World Exhibition of 1878.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  KAULBACH.   THE LUTE PLAYER.]\r\n\r\nAfter all, these pictures will have little that is novel for an\r\nhistorian of the next century. "_\xc3\x8atre ma\xc3\xaetre_," says W. B\xc3\xbcrger, "_c\'est\r\nne ressembler \xc3\xa0 personne._" But these were the works of painters who\r\nmerely announced the dogma of the infallibility of universal\r\neclecticism, as the Caracci had done in their familiar sonnets: they\r\nwere spirited imitators, whose connection with the nineteenth century\r\nwill be known in after years only by the dates of their pictures. As\r\nold masters called back to life, they have enriched the history of art,\r\nas such, by nothing novel. Yet, in replacing superficial imitations by\r\nimitations which were excellent and congenial, they have nevertheless\r\nadvanced the history of art in the nineteenth century in another way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANZ LENBACH.]\r\n\r\nBy the labour of his life each one of them helped to make a place in\r\nGermany for the art of oil-painting, which had been forgotten under the\r\ninfluence of Winckelmann and Carstens, and in this sense their works\r\nwere very important stations, as one might say, on the great\r\nthoroughfare of art. Through systematic imitation of the finest old\r\nmasters, the Munich school had in a comparatively short time regained\r\nthe appreciation of colour and treatment which had so long been lost. At\r\na hazy distance lay those times when the distinctive peculiarity of\r\nGerman painting lay in its wealth of ideas, its want of any sense for\r\ncolour, and its clumsy technique, whilst the \xc3\xa6sthetic spokesmen praised\r\nthese qualities as though they were national virtues. These views had\r\nbeen altogether renounced, and a decade of strenuous work had been\r\ndevoted to the extirpation of all such defects. Such an achievement was\r\nsufficiently great, and sufficiently important and gratifying. This last\r\nresuscitation of the old masters was capable of being turned into a\r\nbridge leading to new regions.\r\n\r\nA feeling arose that the limit had been reached, and it arose in those\r\nvery men who had advanced furthest in pictorial accomplishment, adapting\r\nand making their own all the ability of the old masters. Painters\r\nbelieved that they had learnt enough of technique to be able to treat\r\nsubjects from modern life in the spirit of these old masters, not\r\nhandling them any longer as laboriously composed _genre_ pictures, but\r\nas real works of art. And a group of realists came forward as they had\r\ndone in France, and began to seek truth with scientific rigour and an\r\navoidance of any kind of anecdotic by-play.\r\n\r\nThe greatest pupil of the old masters, _Franz Lenbach_, stands in a\r\nclose and most important relationship with these endeavours of modern\r\nart, through some of his youthful works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  LENBACH.   PORTRAIT OF WILHELM I.]\r\n\r\nThe public has accustomed itself to think of him only as a portrait\r\npainter, and he is justly honoured as the greatest German portraitist of\r\nthe century. But posterity may one day regard it as a special favour of\r\nthe gods that Lenbach should have been born at the right time, and that\r\nhis progress to maturity fell in the greatest epoch of the century. His\r\ngallery of portraits has been called an epic in paint upon the heroes of\r\nour age. The greatest historical figures of the century have sat to him,\r\nthe greatest conquerors and masters in the kingdom of science and art.\r\nNevertheless this gallery would be worthless to posterity if Lenbach had\r\nnot had at his disposal one quality possessed by none of his immediate\r\npredecessors, a sacred respect for nature. At a time when rosy tints,\r\nsuave smiles, and idealised drawing were the requirements necessary in\r\nevery likeness, at a time when Winterhalter painted great men, not as\r\nthey were, but as, in his opinion, they ought to have been--without\r\nreflecting that God Almighty knows best what heads are appropriate for\r\ngreat men--Lenbach appeared with his brusque veracity of portraiture.\r\nThat alone was an achievement in which only a man of original\r\ntemperament could have succeeded. If a portrait painter is to prevail\r\nwith society a peculiar combination of faculties is necessary, apart\r\nfrom his individual capacity for art. Lenbach had not only an eye and a\r\nhand, but likewise elbows and a tongue which placed him _hors concours_.\r\nHe could be as rude as he was amiable, and as deferential as he was\r\nproud; half boor and half courtier, at once a great artist and an\r\naccomplished _faiseur_, he succeeded in doing a thing which has brought\r\nthousands to ruin--he succeeded in forcing upon society his own taste,\r\nand setting genuine human beings of strong character in the place of the\r\nsmiling automatons of fashionable painters. In comparison with the works\r\nof earlier portrait painters it might be said that a touch of pantheism\r\nand nature-worship goes through Lenbach\'s pictures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seeman, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  LENBACH.   PRINCE BISMARK.]\r\n\r\nAnd what makes this so invaluable is that his greatness depends really\r\nless upon artistic qualities than upon his being a highly gifted man who\r\nunderstands the spirit of others. It is not merely artistic technique\r\nthat is essential in a portrait, but before everything a psychical grasp\r\nof the subject. No artist, says Lessing, is able to interpret a power\r\nmore highly spiritual than that which he possesses himself. And this is\r\nprecisely the weak side in so many portrait painters, since a man\'s art\r\nis by no means always in any direct relationship with the development of\r\nhis spiritual powers. In this respect a portrait of Bismarck by Lenbach\r\nstands to one by Anton von Werner, as an interpretation of Goethe by\r\nHehn stands to one by D\xc3\xbcntzer. To speak of the congenial conception in\r\nLenbach\'s pictures of Bismarck is a safe phrase. There will always\r\nremain something wanting, but since Lenbach\'s works are in existence one\r\nknows, at any rate, that this something can be reduced to a far lower\r\nmeasure than it has been by the other Bismarck portraits. "_Bien\r\ncomprendre son homme_," says B\xc3\xbcrger-Thor\xc3\xa9, "_est la premi\xc3\xa8re qualit\xc3\xa9 du\r\nportraitiste_," and this faculty of the gifted psychologist has made\r\nLenbach the historian elect of a great period, the active recorder of a\r\nmighty era. It even makes him seem greater than most foreign portrait\r\npainters. How solid, but at the same time how matter-of-fact, does\r\nBonnat seem by Lenbach\'s side! One should not look at a dozen Bonnats\r\ntogether; a single one arrests attention by the plastic treatment of the\r\nperson, but if you see several at the same time all the figures have\r\nthis same plastic character, all of them have the same pose, and they\r\nall seem to have employed the same tailor. Lenbach has no need of all\r\nthat characterisation by means of accessories in which Bonnat delights.\r\nHe only paints the eyes with thoroughness, and possibly the head; but\r\nthese he renders with a psychological absorption which is only to be\r\nfound amongst modern artists, perhaps in Watts. In a head by Lenbach\r\nthere glows a pair of eyes which burn themselves into you. The\r\ncountenance, which is the first zone around them, is more or\r\nless--generally less--amplified; the second zone, the dress and hands,\r\nis either still less amplified, or scarcely amplified at all. The\r\nportrait is then harmonised in a neutral tone which renders the lack of\r\nfinish less obvious. In this sketchy treatment and in his striking\r\nsubjectivity Lenbach is the very opposite of the old masters. Holbein,\r\nand even Rubens--who otherwise sets upon everything the stamp of his own\r\npersonality--characterised their figures by a reverent imitation of\r\nevery trait given in nature. They produced, as it were, real documents,\r\nand left it to the spectator to interpret them in his own way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LENBACH.   THE SHEPHERD BOY.]\r\n\r\nLenbach, less objective, and surrendering himself less absolutely to his\r\nsubject, emphasises one point, disregards another, and in this way\r\nconjures up the spirit by his faces, just as he sees it. It may be open\r\nto dispute which kind of portraiture is the more desirable; but Lenbach,\r\nat any rate, has now forced the world to behold its great men through\r\nhis eyes. He has given them the form in which they will survive. No one\r\nhas the same secret of seizing a fleeting moment; no one turned more\r\ndecisively away from every attempt at idealising glorification or at\r\nwatering down an individual to a type. He takes counsel of photography,\r\nbut only as Moli\xc3\xa8re took counsel of his housekeeper: he uses it merely\r\nas a medium for arriving at the startling directness, the instantaneous\r\nimpression of life, in his pictures. Works like the portraits of King\r\nLudwig I, Gladstone, Minghetti, Bishop Strossmayer, Prince Lichtenstein,\r\nRichard Wagner, Franz Liszt, Paul Heyse, Wilhelm Busch, Schwind,\r\nSemper, Liphart, Morelli, and many others have no parallel as analyses\r\nof the character of complex personalities. Some of his Bismarck\r\nportraits, as well as his last pictures of the old Emperor Wilhelm, will\r\nalways stand amongst the greatest achievements of the century in\r\nportraiture. In the one portrait is indestructible power, as it were the\r\nshrine built for itself by the mightiest spirit of the century; in the\r\nother the majesty of the old man, already half alienated from the earth,\r\nand glorified by a trace of still melancholy, as by the last radiance of\r\nthe evening sun. In these works Lenbach appears as a wizard calling up\r\nspirits, an _\xc3\xa9vocateur d\'\xc3\xa2mes_, as a French critic has named him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  RAMBERG.   THE MEETING ON THE LAKE.]\r\n\r\nBut what the history of art has forgotten in estimating the fame of the\r\nportrait painter Lenbach is, that in the beginning of his career this\r\nvery man paved the way for the "Realistic" movement in German painting\r\nwhich later he confronted so haughtily and with so much reserve. The\r\nfirst of these works of his, which have for Germany much the same\r\nsignificance as the early works of Courbet have for France, is the\r\nwell-known "Shepherd Boy" in the Schack Gallery. Stretched on his back,\r\nhe lies in the high grass where flowers grow thickly, and looks up while\r\nbutterflies and dragon-flies flutter through the dusty air of a Roman\r\nsummer day. Such a frank, an audacious, naked realism, breaking away\r\nfrom everything traditional in its representation of fact, was something\r\nentirely novel and surprising in Germany in the year 1856. Up to this\r\ntime no one had seen a fragment of nature depicted with such unqualified\r\nveracity. The tanned shepherd lad, with his naked sunburnt feet, covered\r\nby a dark crust of mire from the damp earth, seemed to be lying there in\r\nthe flesh, plastically thrown into relief by the glowing midday sun. The\r\nnext of these pictures, "Peasants taking Refuge from the Weather," which\r\nappeared in the exhibition of 1858, called down a storm of indignation\r\non account of its "trivial realism." Every figure was painted after\r\nnature with blunt and rigorous sincerity, and no anecdotic incident was\r\ndevised in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  HIRTH.   THE HOP HARVEST.]\r\n\r\nAfter the sixties the influence of Courbet began to be directly felt. In\r\nthe days when he worked in Couture\'s studio _Victor M\xc3\xbcller_ had taken up\r\nsome of the ideas of the master of Ornans, and when he settled in 1863\r\nin Munich, M\xc3\xbcller communicated to the painters there the first knowledge\r\nof the works of the great Frenchman. He did not follow Courbet, however,\r\nin his subjects. "The Man in the Heart of the Night lulled to Sleep by\r\nthe Music of a Violin," "Venus and Adonis," "Hero and Leander," "Hamlet\r\nin the Churchyard," "Venus and Tannh\xc3\xa4user," "Faust on the Promenade,"\r\n"Romeo and Juliet," "Ophelia by the Stream"--such are the titles of his\r\nprincipal works. But how far they are removed from the an\xc3\xa6mic, empty\r\npainting of beauty which reigned in the school of Couture! Though a\r\nRomanticist of the purest water in his subjects, M\xc3\xbcller appears, in the\r\nmanner in which he handles them, as a Realist on whom there is no speck\r\nof the academical dust of the schools. The dominant features of Victor\r\nM\xc3\xbcller\'s pictures are the thirst for life and colour, full-blooded\r\nstrength, haughty contempt for every species of hollow exaggeration and\r\nall outward pose, genuine human countenances and living human forms\r\ninspired with tameless passion, an audacious rejection of all the\r\ntraditional rules of composition, and, even in colour, a veracity which\r\nin that age, given up to an ostentatious painting of material, must have\r\nhad an effect that was absolutely novel. In 1863 the blooming flesh of\r\nhis "Wood Nymph" excited the Munich public to indignation, just as the\r\nnude female figures of Courbet had roused indignation about the same\r\ntime in Paris. Pictures painted with singular sureness of hand were\r\nexecuted by him during the few years that he yet had to live--portraits\r\nof dogs, landscapes of a flaming glow of colour, single figures of\r\nred-haired Bacchantes and laughing flower-girls, old men dying, and\r\ncharming fairy pictures. The nearer he came to his death the more his\r\npowers of work seemed to increase. The most remarkable ideas came into\r\nhis head. He drew, and painted without intermission designs which had\r\noccupied him for years. "I feel," he said, "like an architect who has\r\nbeen commissioned to carry out a great building, and I cannot do it: I\r\nmust die."\r\n\r\nBut the impulse which he had given in more than one direction had\r\nfurther issues. As Hans Thoma in later years continued the work of the\r\ngreat Frankfort master in the province of fairy-tale, _Wilhelm Leibl_\r\nrealised M\xc3\xbcller\'s realistic programme.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILHELM LEIBL.   _Kunst f\xc3\xbcr Alle._]\r\n\r\nWilhelm Leibl, son of the conductor of music in the cathedral, was born\r\nat Cologne on 23rd October 1844. At Munich he entered the studio of\r\n_Arthur van Ramberg_, that unjustly forgotten master who, both by his\r\nown work and by his activity as a teacher, exercised upon the younger\r\nMunich school a far healthier influence than Piloty. Ramberg was a\r\nmodern man, was always eager to come into immediate contact with life\r\nand break the fetters of tradition which hung everywhere upon that\r\ngeneration. He was an aristocrat and a dandy, and, having occupied\r\nhimself in the beginning with romantic fairy subjects, he painted, soon\r\nafter his migration to Munich, a series of pictures from modern\r\nlife--"Dachau Girls on Sunday," "The Return from the Masked Ball," "A\r\nWalk with the Tutor," "The Meeting on the Lake," "The Invitation to\r\nBoat," and others, which rose above the mass of contemporary productions\r\nby their great distinction, fragrance, and grace. At a time when others\r\nheld nothing but the smock-frock fit for representation, Ramberg painted\r\nthe fashionable modern costume of women. And when others devoted\r\nthemselves to clumsy _genre_ episodes, he created songs without words\r\nthat were full of fine reserve, nobility, and delicate feeling.\r\n\r\n_Rudolf Hirth_, who made a stir with his "Hop Harvest"; _Albert Keller_,\r\nthe tasteful painter of fashionable life; _Karl Haider_, the sincere and\r\nconscientious miniature painter whose energy of manner had a suggestion\r\nof the old masters, together with Wilhelm Leibl, all issued from\r\nRamberg\'s school, not from Piloty\'s.\r\n\r\nThe young student from Cologne was thus saved, in the beginning, from\r\noccupying himself with history, and he had no need to addict himself to\r\nnarrative _genre_ painting, since his entire organisation preordained\r\nhim to painting pure and simple. Wilhelm Leibl was in those days a\r\nhandsome fellow, with powerful limbs and shining brown eyes. He was\r\nrealism incarnate--rather short, but strongly made, and with a frame\r\nalmost suggesting a beast of burden, broad in the chest,\r\nhigh-shouldered, and bull-necked. His arms were thick and his feet\r\nlarge. His gait was slow, heavy, and energetic, and he made with his\r\narms liberal gestures which took up a good deal of room. He had not the\r\nfiery spirit of Courbet, being more prosaic, sober, and deliberate, but\r\nhe resembled him both in appearance and in the artistic faculty of eye\r\nand hand. "He had," as a French critic wrote of him, "one of those\r\norganisations which are predestined for painting, as Courbet had amongst\r\nus Frenchmen. Such men extract the most remarkable things from\r\npainting."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kunst f\xc3\xbcr Alle._\r\n\r\n  LEIBL.   IN THE STUDIO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _American Art Review._\r\n\r\n  LEIBL.   THE VILLAGE POLITICIANS.]\r\n\r\nEven his first picture, exhibited in 1869, and representing his two\r\nfellow-pupils Rudolf Hirth and Haider looking at an engraving, had a\r\nsoft, full golden harmony, which left all the products of conventional\r\n_genre_ painting far behind it, and came into direct competition with\r\nthe refined works of the Dutch painter Michael Swert. His second\r\npicture, a portrait of Frau Gedon, made an impression even in Paris by\r\nits Rembrandtesque beauty of tone, and was awarded there in 1870 the\r\ngold medal which the judges had not ventured to give him the year before\r\nat Munich, because he was still an Academy pupil. Yet 1869 was the\r\ndecisive year in Leibl\'s life. The Munich Exhibition gave at that time\r\nan opportunity for learning the importance of French art upon a scale\r\npreviously unknown. Over four hundred and fifty pictures were\r\naccessible, and the works of the smooth, conventional historical\r\npainters were the minority. Troyon was to be seen there, and Millet and\r\nCorot. But Courbet, to whose works the committee had devoted an entire\r\nroom, was chiefly the hero, and one over whom there was much conflict.\r\nOpinions were violently at odds about him in the painters\' club. The\r\nofficial circle greeted the master of Ornans with the same hoot of\r\nindignation which had been accorded him in France. But for Leibl he\r\nbecame an adored and marvellous ideal. His eyes sparkled when he sat\r\nopposite him at the _Deutsches Haus_, and in default of any other means\r\nof making himself understood he assured Courbet of his veneration by\r\nsturdily drinking to him: "Prosit Courbet--Prosit Leibl." He stretched\r\nhis powerful limbs, and threw himself into vigorous attitudes to evince\r\nin sanguinary quarrels, when necessary, his enthusiasm for the great\r\nFrenchman. How false and paltry seemed the whole school of Piloty, with\r\nits rose-coloured insipidity and its conventional bloom of the palette,\r\nwhen set against the downright veracity and the masterly painting of\r\nthese works!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kunst f\xc3\xbcr Alle._\r\n\r\n  LEIBL.   THE NEW PAPER.]\r\n\r\nIn the same year he went to Paris, special occasion for the journey\r\nbeing given by a commission for a portrait which he received from the\r\nDuc Tascher de la Pagerie. There he painted "La Cocotte," the portrait\r\nof a fat Frenchwoman seated upon a sofa and watching the clouds of smoke\r\nfrom her clay pipe. In its massive realism, and in the exuberant power\r\nof its broad, liquid painting, it might have been signed "Courbet," and\r\nLeibl told afterwards with pride how Courbet slapped him on the shoulder\r\nwhen he was at his work, saying: "_Il faut que vous restez \xc3\xa0 Paris._"\r\nThe breaking out of the war brought his residence in Paris to an end\r\nmore quickly than he had foreseen, but though he was there only nine\r\nmonths that was long enough to give for ever a firm direction to the\r\nefforts of the painter. Leibl became the apostle of Courbet in Germany,\r\nand in his outward life the German Millet. Back once more in Bavaria, he\r\nmigrated in 1872 to Grasolfingen, then to Schondorf on the Ammersee,\r\nthen to Berbling near Aibling, and in 1884 to Aibling itself; he became\r\na peasant, and, like Millet, he painted pictures of peasants.\r\n\r\nThe poetic and biblical, the august and epical bias which characterises\r\nthe works of Millet, is not to be expected in Leibl. A spirit bent upon\r\nwhat is great and heroic speaks out of Millet\'s pictures. A\r\nRembrandtesque feeling for space, the great line, the simplification,\r\nthe intellectual restraint from anecdotic triviality of form, are the\r\nthings which constitute his style. Leibl is at his best when he buries\r\nhimself with delight in the hundred little touches of nature. He\r\ntriumphs when he has to paint the faces of old peasant women, full of\r\nwrinkles, and furrowed with care; the ruddy cheeks of girls, sparkling\r\nin all their natural rustic freshness; figured dresses, the material and\r\ntexture of which are clearly recognisable; flowered silk kerchiefs worn\r\nround the neck, coarse woollen bodices, and heavy hobnail shoes. He is\r\nto Millet what Holbein is to Michael Angelo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  LEIBL.   IN CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nNor can he be called an artist of intimate feeling in the sense in which\r\nthe Scandinavians are amongst the moderns. In Viggo Johansen the painter\r\ndisappears; what he paints has not the effect of a picture, but of a\r\nmoment of existence, a memory of something clear and familiar--something\r\nwhich has been lived and seen, but not fashioned with deliberate\r\nintention. His figures are like the sudden appearance of actual persons,\r\nspied upon, as if one were looking through the window into a strange\r\nroom under cover of night. One feels that there is no occasion to pay\r\nthe artist a compliment; but one would like to sit in such a warm, cosy\r\nroom, impregnated with tobacco smoke, to inhale the fine cloud of steam\r\nissuing from the tea-kettle, to hear the water bubbling and humming upon\r\nthe glimmering fire. But the painter is always seen in Leibl\'s pictures.\r\nA communicative spirit, something which touches the heart and sets one\r\ndreaming, is precisely what is not expressed in them. The spectator\r\ninvariably thinks, in the first place, of the astonishing ability, the\r\nincredible patience, which went to the making of them. And with all\r\ntheir photographic fidelity he is, moreover, conscious that the painter\r\nhimself was less concerned in seizing the poetry of a scene, the\r\ninstantaneous charm of an impression of nature, than in forcing into the\r\nforeground particular evidences of his technical powers which he has\r\nreserved for display. For instance, newspapers in which, if it is\r\npossible, a fragment of the leading article may be deciphered, earthen\r\nvessels, bottles, and brandy glasses, play in his pictures a _r\xc3\xb4le_\r\nsimilar to that assumed by the little caskets with brass covers that\r\ncatch the flashing lights, the overturned settles, the tapestry, and\r\nthe globe in works of the school of Piloty.\r\n\r\nWilhelm Leibl is a good workman, like Courbet, a man of fresh, vigorous,\r\nand energetic nature and robust health, very material, and at times\r\nmatter-of-fact and prosaic. Painting is as natural to him as breathing\r\nand walking are to the rest of us. He goes his way like an ox in the\r\nplough, steadily and without tiring, without vibration of the nerves,\r\nand without the touch of poetry. He goes where his instinct leads him\r\nand paints with a muscular flexibility of hand whatever appeals to his\r\neye or suits his brush. Opposed to the neurotic and hurrying moderns, he\r\nhas something of a medi\xc3\xa6val monk who sits quietly in his cell, without\r\ncounting the hours, the days, and the years, and embellishes the pages\r\nof his service-book with artistic miniatures, to depart in peace when he\r\nhas set "Amen, Finis" at the bottom of the last page. But he has, too,\r\nall the capacity and all the boundless veneration for nature of these\r\nold artists. He is the greatest _ma\xc3\xaetre peintre_ that Germany has had in\r\nthe course of the century, and in this sense his advent was of\r\nepoch-making importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  LEIBL.   A PEASANT DRINKING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEIBL.   IN THE PEASANT\'S COTTAGE.]\r\n\r\nEven Defregger had observed peasant life altogether from a narrative and\r\nanecdotic point of view. In Leibl this narrative _genre_ has been\r\novercome. He had ability enough to give artistic attractions even to an\r\n"empty subject." To avoid exaggerated characterisation, to avoid the\r\nexpression of anything divided into _r\xc3\xb4les_, he consistently painted\r\npeople employed in the least exciting occupations--peasants reading a\r\nnewspaper, sitting in church, or examining a gun. Pains are taken to\r\navoid the slightest movement of the figures. Whilst all his predecessors\r\nwere romance writers, Leibl is a painter. His themes--simple scenes of\r\ndaily life--are a matter of indifference; the beauty of his pictures\r\nlies in their technique. They are works of which it may be said that\r\nevery attempt to give an impression of them in words is useless, for\r\nthey have not proceeded from delight in anecdotic theme, but, as in the\r\ngood periods of art, from the discipline of the sense for colour and\r\nfrom an eminent capacity for drawing: they are pictures in which mere\r\ninterest in subject is lost in the consideration of their artistic\r\nvalue, while the matter of what is represented is entirely thrown into\r\nthe background by the manner in which it is carried out. The chief aim\r\nof the historical as of the _genre_ painters had been to draw a fluent\r\ncartoon based upon single studies, to mix the colours nicely upon the\r\npalette, lay them upon the canvas according to the rules, blend them and\r\nlet them dry, so as then to attain the proper harmony of colour by\r\npainting over again and finally glazing. Leibl\'s mastery, which of\r\nitself resulted in an astonishing truth to nature, lay in seizing an\r\nimpression as quickly as possible, taking hold of the reality rightly at\r\nthe first glance, and transferring the colours to his canvas with\r\ndecision and sureness, in clear accord with the hues of the original.\r\nLessing\'s maxim, "From the eyes straight to the arm and the brush," has\r\nbeen realised here for the first time in Germany.\r\n\r\nAs yet no German had, in the same measure, what the painter calls\r\nqualities, and even in France two apparently heterogeneous faculties\r\nhave seldom been united in one master in the same measure as they were\r\nin Leibl: a broad and large technique, a bold _alla prima_ painting,\r\nand, on the other hand, a joy in work of detail with a fine brush, such\r\nas was known by Quentin Matsys, the smith of Antwerp. "The Village\r\nPoliticians" of 1879 was the chief work that he painted in Schondorf.\r\nWhat would Knaus, the king of illustration and the ruler over the\r\nprovince of vignettes, have made out of this theme! By a literary\r\nevasion he would have subordinated the interest of the picture to his\r\nideas. One would have learnt what it is that peasants read, and received\r\ninstruction as to their political allegiance to party and their offices\r\nand honours in the village: that would be the magistrate, that the\r\nsmith, and that the tailor. In Leibl there are true and simple peasants,\r\nwho, by way of relaxation from the toil of the week, listen stupidly and\r\nindifferently to the reading of a Sunday paper, in which one of them is\r\nendeavouring to discover the village news and the price of crops. They\r\nare harsh-featured and common, but they have been spared theatrical\r\nembellishment and impertinent satire; they are not artistically grouped,\r\nthough they sit there in all the rusticity of their physiognomies, and\r\nall the angularity of their attitudes, without polish or Sunday state.\r\nLeibl renders the reality without altering it, but he renders it fully\r\nand entirely. The fidelity to nature held fast on the canvas surpassed\r\neverything that had hitherto been seen, and it was gained, moreover, by\r\nthe soundest and the simplest means. Whereas Lenbach, in his effort to\r\nreproduce the colour-effects of the old masters, destroyed the\r\ndurability of his pictures even while he worked upon them, Leibl seemed\r\nto have chosen as his motto the phrase which D\xc3\xbcrer once used in writing\r\nto Jacob Heller: "I know that, if you preserve the picture well, it will\r\nbe fresh and clean at the end of five hundred years, for it has not been\r\npainted as pictures usually are in these days."\r\n\r\nHe took a further step in the direction of truth when he made a\r\ntransition from the Dutch towards the old German masters. After he had,\r\nin his earlier productions, worked very delicately at the tone of his\r\npictures, and, for a time, had particularly sought to attain specific\r\neffects of _chiaroscuro_, attaching himself to Rembrandt, he took up an\r\nindependent position in his conception of colour, painting everything\r\nnot as one of the old masters might have seen it, but as he had seen it\r\nhimself. All the tricks of painting and sleights of virtuosity were\r\ndespised, special emphasis being scarcely laid upon pictorial unity of\r\neffect. Everything was simple and true to nature, and had a sincerity\r\nwhich is not to be surpassed.\r\n\r\nThe picture of the three peasant women, "In Church," is the masterpiece\r\nin this "second manner" of his, and when it appeared in the Munich\r\nInternational Exhibition of 1883 it was an event. From that date Leibl\r\nwas established--at any rate in the artistic circles of Munich--as the\r\ngreatest German _painter_ of his time. That Leibl painted the picture\r\nwithout sketching for himself an outline, that he began with the eye of\r\nthe peasant girl and painted bit by bit, like fragments of a mosaic, was\r\na feat of technique in which there were few to imitate him. The young\r\ngeneration in Munich studied the pages of the service-book and the\r\nsquares of the gingham dress, the girl\'s jug and the carvings of the\r\npew, with astonishment, as though they were the work of magic. They were\r\nbeside themselves with delight over such unheard-of strength, power, and\r\ndelicacy of modelling, the fusion of colour suggesting Holbein, and the\r\nintimate study of nature. They perpetually discovered new points that\r\ncame upon them as a surprise, and many felt as Wilkie did when he sat in\r\nMadrid before the drinkers of Velasquez, and at last rose wearily with a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  LEIBL.   A TAILOR\'S WORKSHOP.]\r\n\r\nLeibl did for Germany what the pre-Raphaelites did for England. Men and\r\nwomen were represented with astonishing pains just as they sat and\r\nsuffered themselves to be painted. He was determined to give the whole,\r\npure truth, and he gave it; that, and nothing more and nothing less. He\r\nreproduced nature in her minutest traits and in her finest movements,\r\nbringing the imitative side of art to the highest perfection\r\nconceivable. In virtue of these qualities he was a born portrait\r\npainter; and although he never had "conception," as Lenbach had, his\r\nportraits belong, with those of Lenbach, to the best German\r\nperformances of the century. Only Holbein when he painted his "Gysze"\r\nhad this remorseless manner of analysing the human countenance in every\r\nwrinkle. Leibl once more taught the German painters to go into detail,\r\nand led them constantly to hold nature as the only source of art; and\r\nthat has been the beginning of every renaissance.\r\n\r\nHis works were pictorially the most complete expression of the aims of\r\nthe Munich school in colour. As a representative of the efforts of the\r\ndecade from 1870 he is as typical as Cornelius for the art of the\r\nthirties, Piloty for that of the fifties, and as Liebermann became later\r\nas a representative of the efforts of the eighties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF THE JAPANESE\r\n\r\n\r\nCourbet and Ribot for France, Holman Hunt and Madox Brown for England,\r\nStevens for Belgium, Menzel, Lenbach, and Leibl for Germany, are the\r\ngreat names of modern Realism, the names of the men who subjected modern\r\nlife to art, and subjected art to the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nOne point, however, the question of colour, still remained unsolved: as\r\nthe preceding generation took their form, so these painters took their\r\ncolour, not from nature, but from the treasury of old art.\r\n\r\nCourbet announced it as his programme to express the manners, ideas, and\r\naspect of his age--in a word, to create living art. He described himself\r\nas the sincere lover of _la v\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9 vraie_: "_la v\xc3\xa9ritable peinture doit\r\nappeler son spectateur par la force et par la grande v\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9 de son\r\nimitation_." But one may question how far his figures, and the\r\nenvironment of them, are true in colour? Where there is a delightful\r\nsubtlety of fleeting _nuances_ in nature, an oppressive opaque heaviness\r\nis found in this modern Caravaggio of Franche-Comt\xc3\xa9. He certainly\r\npainted modern stone-breakers, but it was in the tone of saints of the\r\nSpanish school of the seventeenth century. His pictures of artisans have\r\nthe odour of the museum. The home of his men and women is not the open\r\nfield of Ornans, but that room in the Louvre where hang the pictures of\r\nCaravaggio.\r\n\r\n_Alfred Stevens_ made a great stride by painting modern _Parisiennes_.\r\nWhereas the costume picture had up to his time sought the truth of the\r\nold masters only in the matter of the skirts which the fashion of their\r\nage prescribed, Stevens was the first to dress his women in the garb of\r\n1860, just as Terborg painted his in the costume of 1660 and not of\r\n1460. But the very atmosphere in which the _Parisienne_ of the\r\nnineteenth century lived is no longer that in which the women of de\r\nHoogh moved. The whole of life is brighter. The studios in which\r\npictures are painted are brighter, and the rooms in which they are\r\ndestined to hang. Van der Meer of Delft, the greatest painter of light\r\namongst the Dutch, still worked behind little casements; and in dusky\r\npatrician dwellings, "where the very light of heaven breaks sad through\r\npainted window," his pictures were ultimately hung. The old masters paid\r\nspecial attention to these conditions of illumination. The golden\r\nharmony of the Italian Renaissance came into being from the character of\r\nthe old cathedrals furnished with glass windows of divers colours; the\r\nhalf-light of the Dutch corresponded to the dusky studios in which\r\npainters laboured, and the gloomy, brown-wainscoted rooms for which\r\ntheir pictures were destined. The nineteenth century committed the\r\nmistake even here of regarding what was done to meet a special case as\r\nsomething absolute. Rooms had long become bright when studios were\r\nartificially darkened, and artists still sought, by means of coloured\r\nwindows and heavy curtains, to subdue the light, so as to be able to\r\npaint in tones dictated by the old masters. Stevens shed over a modern\r\nwoman, a _Parisienne_, sitting in a drawing-room in the Avenue de Jena,\r\nthe light of Gerard Dow, without reflecting that this illumination,\r\nfiltered through little lattice-windows, was quite correct in Holland\r\nduring the seventeenth century, but no longer proper in the Paris of\r\n1860, in a salon where the windows had great cross-bars and clear white\r\npanes which were not leaded. It is chiefly this that makes his pictures\r\nuntrue, lending them an old Flemish heaviness, something earthy,\r\nsavouring of the clay, and not in keeping with the fresh fragrance of\r\nthe modern _Parisienne_. Her modernity is seen through the yellowish\r\nglass which the old Flemish masters seemed to hold between Stevens and\r\nhis model.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Quantin, Paris._\r\n\r\n  HOKUSAI IN THE COSTUME OF A JAPANESE WARRIOR.]\r\n\r\nConsidered as a separate personality _Ribot_, too, is a great artist;\r\nhis works are masterpieces. Yet when young men spoke of him as the last\r\nrepresentative of the school of cellar-windows there was an atom of\r\ntruth in what they said. Like Courbet, he continued the art of\r\ngalleries. The master of a style and yet the servant of a manner, he\r\nmarks the summit of a tendency in which the great traditions of Frans\r\nHals and Ribera were once more embodied. When he paints subjects\r\nresembling the themes of these old masters he is as great as they are,\r\nas genuine and as much a master of style; but as soon as he turns to\r\nother subjects the imitative mannerist is revealed. Even things as\r\ntender and unsubstantial as the flowers of the field seem as if they\r\nwere made of wax. His disdain for what is light, fluent, and fickle,\r\nlike air and water, is evident in his sea-pieces. His steamers plough\r\ntheir way through a greyish-black sea beneath a thick black stormy sky,\r\nas though through grey deserts. Nature quivering in the air and bathed\r\nin light is not so heavy and compact, nor has it such plasticity of\r\nappearance. His women reading are the _ne plus ultra_ of painting; only\r\nit is astonishing that any human being can read in such a dark room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Quantin, Paris._\r\n\r\n  HOKUSAI.   WOMEN BATHING.]\r\n\r\nRibot\'s parallel in Germany is _Lenbach_, who had less pictorial and\r\ngreater intellectual power. As a painter of copies, particularly copies\r\nof the artists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, he formed and\r\nperfected a school for the understanding of the old masters, as none of\r\nhis contemporaries had done. The copies which he made as a young man for\r\nCount Schack in Italy and Spain are probably the best translations by\r\nthe brush that have ever been executed. He has reproduced Titian and\r\nRubens, Velasquez and Giorgione, with equal magic; no other painter has\r\nentered into all the subtleties of their technique with such\r\nintelligence and keenness; and by the aid of these sleights of art,\r\nwhich he learnt as a copyist from classic masterpieces, he communicated\r\nto his own works that impress which qualifies them for the gallery and\r\nsuggests the old masters with such refinement. His pictures mark the\r\nsummit of ability reached in Germany in the pictorial style of the old\r\nartists.\r\n\r\nBut, at the same time, his weakness lies in this very eminence. The man\r\nwho had passed through the high-school of the old masters with the\r\ngreatest success was entered as a student for life, and never took the\r\nprofessorial chair himself. Helferich has called him the impersonated\r\nspirit of the galleries, the spirit which is centuries old.\r\n\r\nThis indicates the direction which must be taken by the further\r\ndevelopment of painting. A really new and independent art must finally\r\nemancipate itself from the Renaissance colouring, the tone of Church\r\npainting, and the _chiaroscuro_ of pictures painted behind the\r\nvariegated panes of lattice-windows. It must be evident that the methods\r\nof the old Spanish and old Dutch schools, excellent in themselves, were\r\nfully in keeping with strange scenes of martyrdom or quiet interiors\r\nwith peasants and fat matrons, but that they could not possibly be\r\nemployed in pictures of artisans beneath the free sky, nor in those of\r\nelegant interiors of our own days, nor of pale and delicate\r\n_Parisiennes_ attired in silks, beings of a new epoch. A different\r\nperiod necessitates different methods. It is not merely that the\r\nsubjects of art change, but the way in which they are handled must bear\r\nthe marks of the period. Nature should no longer be studied through the\r\nprism of old pictures, and the phrase _beau par la v\xc3\xa9rit\xc3\xa9_ must be\r\nexalted to a principle applying to colour also.\r\n\r\nThe pre-Raphaelites and Menzel were the first to become alive to the\r\nproblem. They were never taken captive by the tones of the early\r\nmasters, but placed themselves always in conscious opposition to the\r\nartists of older ages. The battle against "brown sauce" even formed an\r\nessential point in the programme of the Brotherhood. They protested\r\nagainst conventional colouring as violently as against the sweeping line\r\ntaught by traditional rules of beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Quantin, Paris._\r\n\r\n  HOKUSAI.   FUSIYAMA SEEN THROUGH A SAIL.]\r\n\r\nBut, as so often happens in the nineteenth century, though the English\r\nfound the jewel, they did not understand how to cut it. The\r\npre-Raphaelites had a quickening influence, in exciting a feeling for\r\nhue and tint, and rendering it keener by their own insistence on the\r\nelementary effects of colour. They sought to free themselves from brown\r\nsauce and to be just to local tones, through straightforward,\r\nindependent observation. They painted the trees green, the earth grey,\r\nthe sky blue, the sunbeams yellow, in sharply accentuated colours, as\r\nlittle blended as possible. But in most cases the result was not\r\nparticularly pleasant; there was almost always a hard, motley colouring\r\nwhich produced a most unpleasant, glaring effect. Their audacity was\r\nsomewhat barbaric. There was a want of warmth and softness, the\r\natmosphere did not combine the whole by its mitigating and harmonising\r\npower. Even Madox Brown\'s "Work" is an offensive chaos of crying\r\ncolours. The bright clothes, the blue blouses, the red uniforms have a\r\ngaudy and unquiet effect. The problem was attacked, but the solution was\r\nharsh and crude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOKUSAI.   FUSIYAMA SEEN THROUGH REEDS.]\r\n\r\nOf _Menzel\'s_ pictures the same is true, though not perhaps in the same\r\ndegree. In pictorial conception he also has not quite reached the\r\nsummit. His method of painting is sometimes sparkling and full of\r\nspirit, holding the mean, more or less, between the quiet and plain\r\npainting of Meissonier and the crisp, glittering style of Fortuny; he\r\nlets off a flickering, dazzling, rocket-like firework, but at bottom he\r\nhas been cut from the block from which draughtsmen are made. Sometimes\r\nit is astonishing how his brush sweeps over costumes, ornaments, and\r\nbuildings, but he does not think in colour; it is supplementary to the\r\ndrawing, and not of earlier origin, nor even of equal birth. Much as he\r\ntried to paint smoke and steam in his "Iron Mill," he had no\r\nunderstanding for atmospheric life; for this reason harsh and glaring\r\ntones almost invariably make a disturbing effect in his works. His\r\n"Piazza d\'Erbe" as well as his "King Wilhelm setting out to join the\r\nArmy" have a motley and restless effect in the picture, and only in\r\nphotography or black and white do they acquire something of the\r\nsimplicity which is to be desired in the originals. The best of his\r\ndrawings may stand beside the sketches of D\xc3\xbcrer without detriment; to\r\nplace his pictures on the same level is impossible, because quietude and\r\npure harmony are wanting in them.\r\n\r\nSo extremes meet. Courbet, Ribot, and Lenbach are greater connoisseurs\r\nof colour than Europe had seen previous to their appearance, but this\r\nthey are at the expense of truth; they have identified themselves with\r\nthe old masters, and not arrived at any personal conception of colour.\r\nMenzel and the pre-Raphaelites despised the old masters, but their\r\nconception of colour had something primitive, jarring, and\r\nundisciplined.\r\n\r\nThe note of truth was still missing in the mighty orchestra. By what\r\npossible means could it be supplied? How bring to perfection that great\r\nharmony which is ever the end and aim of all true artistic effort. It\r\nwas not until the art of the Far East was unfolded before the eyes of\r\nWestern painters that this disquieting problem reached its solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Quantin, Paris._\r\n\r\n  HOKUSAI.   AN APPARITION.]\r\n\r\nIn the year in which Millet exhibited his "Winnower" and Courbet painted\r\nhis "Stone-breakers" a man died in the Far East whose name was Hokusai.\r\nHe was the last great representative of an art of painting more than a\r\nthousand years old--one which had no Raphael, Correggio, or Titian,\r\nthough it was, nevertheless, art in the loftiest meaning of the word.\r\nMarco Polo, the great traveller of the Middle Ages, had told of a\r\nremarkable land "towards the sunrise," the soil of which it was not\r\npermitted to him to tread. And the artistic views of the eighteenth\r\ncentury were revolutionised when the first Japanese porcelain and\r\nlacquer-work arrived at the Courts of Dresden and Paris. The aged Louis\r\nXIV himself began to find pleasure in idols, pagodas, and "stuffs\r\nprinted with flowers." In a short time these works formed an important\r\npart of superior collections, and led to the movement against the\r\ninflexible despotism of the pompous Lebrun style. For the Japanese gave\r\nEurope the unfettered principles of a freer intuition of beauty; they\r\nexcited a preference for things which were unsymmetrical, capricious,\r\nfull of movement, for everything by which the charming Louis XV style is\r\nto be distinguished from the tiresome academic art of Louis XIV. In the\r\nsixties of the nineteenth century Japan exerted, for the second time, a\r\nrevolutionary influence on the development of European painting. If\r\nJapanese productions were in earlier days regarded as curiosities, for\r\nwhich place was to be found in cabinets of rarities, as trifles the\r\nartistic value of which was less prized than the dexterity of their\r\nconstruction, it was reserved for the present age to do justice to\r\nJapanese art as such.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOKUSAI.   HOKUSAI SKETCHING THE PEERLESS MOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\nAs is well known, oil-painting exists neither in China nor Japan. Just\r\nas the Japanese choose the slightest material for building, so\r\neverything in their painting bears a trace of extreme lightness.\r\nJapanese pictures, _kakemonos_, are painted in water colour or Chinese\r\nink upon framed silk or paper; but this paper has an advantage over the\r\nEuropean article in its unsurpassed toughness, its remarkable softness\r\nand pliability, its surface which has either a dull, silky lustre, or\r\nmay only be compared with the finest parchment. And the pictures\r\nthemselves are kept rolled up, and only hung, as occasion offers, in\r\nthe Tokonama, the little closet near the reception-room, and according\r\nto very refined rules. Only a few are hung at a time, and only such as\r\nharmonise. When a visit is expected the taste of the guest determines\r\nthe selection. Fresh and variously coloured flowers and branches, placed\r\nnear them in vases, are obliged to harmonise in colour with the\r\npictures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TANYU.   THE GOD HOTE\xc3\x8f ON A JOURNEY.]\r\n\r\nAs an instrument for painting use is only made of the pliant brush of\r\nhair, which executes everything with a free and fluent effect. Pen,\r\ncrayon, or chalk, and all hard mediums which offer resistance, are\r\nconsistently excluded. The subject-matter of these pictures is\r\nsurprisingly rich, and assumes for their proper understanding some\r\nacquaintance with Japanese literature. An opulent folk-lore, in which\r\ncannibals and heroes like Tom Thumb live and move and have their being,\r\njust as in European fairy stories, stands at the disposal of the artist.\r\nHistorical representations from the life of fabulous national heroes,\r\nghosts, and apparitions half man and half bird, alternate with simple\r\nlandscapes and scenes from daily life. And in all pictures, whether they\r\nare fanciful or plain renderings of fact, attention is riveted by the\r\nsame keenness of observation, the same refinement of taste, in the\r\nhighest sense of the word by pictorial charm. After the Japanese have\r\nbeen long recognised as the first decorative artists in the world, after\r\nthe highest praise has been accorded to them in the industrial crafts\r\ntaken jointly--in lacquer-work and bronze work, weaving, embroidery,\r\nand pottery--they are now likewise celebrated as the most spirited\r\ndraughtsmen in existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Studio._\r\n\r\n  KORIN.   LANDSCAPE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Studio._\r\n\r\n  KORIN.   RABBITS.]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese artist lives with nature and in her as no artist of any\r\nother country has ever done. Life in the open air creates a relation to\r\nnature suggestive of the doctrines of Rousseau; it makes earth, sky, and\r\nwater as familiar to man as are the beings that move in them. Every\r\nhouse, even in the centre of towns, has a garden laid out with fine\r\ntaste, and combining beautiful flowers, trees, and cascades, everything\r\nincidental to the soil. The form of trees, the shape and colour of\r\nflowers, the ripple of leaves, and the gleaming mail of insects are so\r\nimprinted in the memory of the painter that his fancy can summon them at\r\npleasure without the need of fresh study. The most fleeting moment of\r\nthe life of nature is held as firmly in his mind as the everlasting form\r\nof rocks and gigantic trees shadowing the temple groves of Nippon. Every\r\none of these artists works with the unfettered falcon glance of the\r\nchild of nature. His keen eye sees in the flight of birds turns and\r\nmovements first revealed to us by instantaneous photography. This\r\nquickness of eye and this astonishing exercise of memory enable him to\r\nobtain the most striking effects with the slightest means. If a Japanese\r\nexecutes figures, race, station, age, business, personality are all\r\nseized with the keenest vision, and pregnantly rendered in their\r\nessential features. Robes and unclad forms, heads and limbs, animated\r\nand still nature, are all reproduced with the same reality. Yet little\r\nas the doctrine ever gained ground that to create works of art nature\r\nshould be mastered upon a system, trivial realism was just as little at\r\nany time the vogue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  OKIO.   A CARP.]\r\n\r\nThe love of nature is born in the Japanese, but the photographic\r\nimitation, the servile reproduction of reality, is never his ultimate\r\naim. Geoffroy has noted with much subtlety the resemblance which exists\r\nbetween Japanese poets and painters in this respect. Their poets never\r\ndescribe, but only endeavour to express a spiritual feeling, to hold a\r\nmemory fast--the blitheness of smiling pleasure, the mournfulness of\r\nvanished joy. They sing of the mist passing over the mountain summits,\r\nthe fishing boats, the reeds by the seashore, the plash of waves, the\r\nflying streaks of cloud, the sunset streaming purple over the weary\r\nworld. The same economy of means, the same sureness in the choice of\r\ncharacteristic features, and a similar rapidity in striking the keynote\r\nare peculiar to the painters. They, too, express themselves by the\r\nscantiest means, shrink from saying too much, and aim only at a rapid\r\nand right expression of total effect, leaving to the imagination the\r\ntask of supplementing and amplifying what is given. The heaviness of\r\nmatter is overcome, the absurd pretence of reality not attempted. Like\r\nthe French of the eighteenth century, the Japanese possess the sportive\r\ngrace, the _esprit_ of the brush hovering over objects, extracting\r\nmerely their bloom and essence, and using them as the basis for free and\r\nindependent caprices of beauty. They have the remarkable faculty of\r\nbeing synthetic and discarding every ponderous and disturbing element,\r\nwithout losing the local accent in a landscape or a figure. They fasten\r\nupon the most vivid impression of things, but in great, comprehensive\r\nlines, subordinating every peculiarity to the light which shines upon\r\nthem and the shadow in which they are muffled. Their handwriting is at\r\nonce broad and precise, graceful and bizarre. What a nonchalant,\r\nfragile, piquant, or coquettish effect have their feminine figures! And\r\nbut a few firm strokes sufficed to create the impression. A dexterous\r\nsweep of the brush was all that was necessary for the modelling, all\r\nthat was wanted to summon the idea of the velvet softness of the flesh\r\nand the firmness of the bosom. Or surging waves have been painted, or\r\nfoaming cataracts. But with what consummate mastery, with what peculiar\r\nknowledge, the swirl and eddying of the waters have been represented.\r\nAnd how slight are the means which have been employed! Everything has\r\nthe freshness of life, and the sheer, intangible movement of objects has\r\nbeen caught by a simple and decisive line. A few dashes of Chinese ink\r\nare made, and the forcible strokes unite without effort in forming a\r\nmountain path or a hillside stream foaming over rocks and trees. Or the\r\nprow of a vessel is represented. Nothing is to be seen of the water, and\r\nyet it is as if the waves were rocking the ship. The billow swells,\r\nrises, and sinks, suggesting the wide sea, the rhythm in the universe.\r\nThe lines in which the motives are executed render only what is\r\nessential. But combined with this striving after simplified form there\r\nis a sense of space which of itself, as it were, controls everything,\r\nproducing the poetic illusion of distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIROSHIGE.   THE BRIDGE AT YEDDO.]\r\n\r\nThe Japanese are masters of the art of enlarging a narrow picture frame\r\nto a great expanse, and indicating by a few strokes the distance between\r\nforeground and horizon. There is often nothing, or next to nothing, in\r\nthe wide space, but proximity and distance are so correctly related that\r\nall the geological structure is clear, whilst light air is pervasive,\r\ngiving the eye a vision of boundless perspective. The spur of a\r\nheadland, the bank of a river, or a cleft between two mountains enables\r\nthe eye to measure far landscapes. In the presence of their works one\r\ndreams, one has the presentiment of infinite distances. They divest\r\nobjects of their earthiness by bold simplifications, and transform\r\nreality into dreamland. It is the spirit of things, their smile, and\r\ntheir intangible perfume which live in these veiled masterpieces which\r\nare yet so precise.\r\n\r\nThe bold irregularity of Japanese works, which know nothing of the\r\nstiffness of symmetrical composition, contributes much to this\r\nimpression. Their pictures are never "composed" in our sense of the\r\nword, but rather resemble the instantaneous pictures of photographers.\r\nA bird is seen to dart past, only half visible, a cluster of trees is a\r\nchance slice from the forest, as it is seen out of the window of a\r\nrailway train whizzing past. Or it is merely the bough of a tree with a\r\nbird upon it that stretches into the picture, which is otherwise filled\r\nwith a fragment of blue sky. Without appearing to concern themselves\r\nabout it, they compose little poems of grace and freshness, with a frog,\r\na butterfly, and a blossoming apple-branch sprouting out of a vase. They\r\nplay with beetles, grasshoppers, tortoises, crabs, and fish as did the\r\nartists of the Renaissance with Cupids and angels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIROSHIGE.   A HIGH ROAD.]\r\n\r\nAnd in everything, as regards colour too, the Japanese have a strain of\r\nrefinement peculiar to themselves. It is as though they were controlled\r\nby the finest tact, as by a _force majeure_, even in their intuition of\r\ncolour. That great harmony of which Th\xc3\xa9odore Rousseau spoke, and to\r\nwhich it was the aim of his life to attain, is reached by the Japanese\r\nartist almost instinctively. The most vivid effects of red and green\r\ntrees, yellow roads, and blue sky are represented; the most refined\r\neffects of light are rendered--illuminated bridges, dark firmaments, the\r\nwhite sickle of the moon, glittering stars, the bright and rosy blossoms\r\nof spring, the dazzling snow as it falls upon trim gardens; and there\r\nare discords nowhere. How heavy and motley our colouring is compared\r\nwith these delicious chords, set beside each other so boldly, and\r\ninvariably so harmonious. Is it that our eyes are by nature less\r\ndelicate? or is everything in the Japanese only the result of a more\r\nrational training? We have not the same intense force of perception,\r\nthis instinctive and sensuous gift of colour. Their colouring is a\r\ndelight to the eyes, a magic potion. Offence is nowhere given by a\r\nglaring or an entirely crude tone; everything is finely calculated,\r\ndelicately indicated, and has that melting softness so enchanting in\r\nJapanese enamel. The simplest chords of colour are often the most\r\neffective; nothing can be more charming than the delicate duet of grey\r\nand gold. And the cheapest wood-cut has often all these refinements in\r\ncommon with the most costly _kakemono_. Even here, where they turn to\r\nlowly things, their art is never vulgar, but maintains itself at such an\r\naristocratic height that we barbarians of the West, blessed with\r\noleographs and Academies of Art, can only look up with envy to this\r\nnation of connoisseurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIROSHIGE.   A LANDSCAPE.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest of these Japanese artists working in wood-cut engraving was\r\nMatahei, who lived in the beginning of the seventeenth century, and\r\nexecuted scenes from the theatres and Japanese family and street life.\r\nIcho and Moronobu followed at the close of the seventeenth century, the\r\none being a spirited caricaturist, the other a genuine _baroque_ artist\r\nof noble and classic reserve. Through the masters of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, as through Eisen, Fragonard, and Boucher, this reproductive art\r\ntook fresh development. The soft girls of Souk\xc3\xa9nobu with their delicate\r\nround faces, the graceful beauties of Harunobu arrayed in costly\r\ntoilettes, the tall feminine forms of the marvellous Outamaro in all\r\ntheir provocative charm, the vivid scenes from popular life of the great\r\ncolourist Shunsho, are works pervaded with a delicate perfume of which\r\nEdmond de Goncourt alone could render any impression in words.\r\n\r\nOutamaro, the poet of women, was, in a special sense, the Watteau of\r\naristocratic life in Japan. He knew the life of the Japanese woman as no\r\nother has ever done--her domestic occupations, her walks and her\r\ncharming graces, her vanities and her love affairs. He knew also the\r\nscenes of nature which she contemplated, the streets through which she\r\npassed, and the banks along which she sauntered with an undulating step.\r\nHis women are slender beings, isolated like idols, and standing\r\nmotionless in poses hieratically august; \xc3\xa6sthetic souls, who swoon and\r\ngrow pale under the sway of disquieting visions; fading flowers, forms\r\nroaming wearily by the verge of a lonely sea or a sluggish stream, or\r\nflitting timidly, like bats, through the soft brilliancy of lights amid\r\na festival by night. And in killing what is fleshly and physical he\r\nrenders the faces visionary and dreamy, renders the hands and the\r\ngestures finer, and at the same time subdues and mitigates the colours\r\nand the splendour of the clothes, taking pleasure in dying chords, in\r\ndeep black and tender white, in fine, pallid _nuances_ of rose-colour\r\nand lilac. Every one of his pupils became a fresh chronicler of\r\naristocratic life. Toyohami painted night festivals; Toyoshiru, animated\r\ncrowds; Toyokumi, scenes of the theatre; Kunisada, women upon their\r\nwalks; Kunioshi, melodramatic representations full of pomp, with\r\nmarvellous fantastic landscapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Quantin, Paris._\r\n\r\n  HIROSHIGE.   SNOWY WEATHER.]\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century brought the widest popularisation of art,\r\ncorresponding more or less to the "resort to popular national life," as\r\nthe beginning of modern _genre_ painting and of the modern art of\r\nillustration was called in Germany. The refined son of Nippon shrugs his\r\nshoulders over these last creations of Japanese reproduction in colours;\r\nhe prefers those earlier charming masters of grace, and misses the\r\naristocratic _cachet_ in the new men, with as much justification as the\r\nrefined European collector has when he does not care to place the plates\r\nof Granville or Dor\xc3\xa9 in a portfolio with those of Eisen or Fragonard.\r\nNevertheless amongst the draughtsmen who followed the popular tendency\r\nthere was at any rate one great genius, one of the most important\r\nartists of his country, who became more familiar to Europe than any of\r\nhis other compatriots: this was _Hokusai_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN UNKNOWN MASTER.   HARVESTERS RESTING.]\r\n\r\nAll the qualities of Japanese art are united in him as in a focus. His\r\nwork is the encyclop\xc3\xa6dia of a whole nation, and in his technical\r\nqualities he stands by the side of the greatest men in Europe. He is the\r\nmost attentive observer, a painter of manners as no other has ever been;\r\nhe takes strict measure of everything, analysing the slightest\r\nmovements. He draws the solid things of earth, the immovable rocks, the\r\neverlasting prim\xc3\xa6val mountains, and yet follows the changing phenomena\r\nof light and shade upon its surface. He has, in the highest degree, that\r\npeculiarly Japanese quality of giving tangible expression to the\r\nmovements of things and living creatures. His men and women gesticulate,\r\nhis animals run, his birds fly, his reptiles crawl, his fish swim; the\r\nleaves on the trees, the water of the rivers, and the sea and the clouds\r\nof the sky move gently. He is a magnificent landscape painter,\r\ncelebrating all the seasons, from blossoming spring to ice-bound winter.\r\nIn his designs he maps out orchards, fields, and woods, follows the\r\nwinding course of rivers, summons a fine mist from the sea, sends the\r\nwaves surging forward, and the billows racing up against the rocks and\r\nlosing themselves as murmuring rivulets in the sand. But he is also a\r\nphilosopher and a poet of wide flight, who makes the boldest journeys\r\ninto the land of dreams. His imagination rises above the work-a-day\r\nworld, rides upon the chimera, bodies forth a new life, creates\r\nmonsters, and tells visions of terrible poetry. The deep feeling of the\r\nprimitive masters revives in him, and he appears as a strange mystic,\r\nwhen he paints his blithe ethereal goddesses, or that old Buddhist who,\r\nwhen banished, came every day across the sea, as the legend tells, to\r\nbehold once more Fuji, the sacred mountain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Studio._\r\n\r\n  OUTAMARO.   MOTHER\'S LOVE.]\r\n\r\nHokusai was born in 1760, amid flowery gardens in a quiet corner of\r\nYeddo, fourteen years after Goya and twelve years after David. His\r\nfather was purveyor of metallic mirrors to the Court. Hokusai took\r\nlessons from an illustrator, but does not seem to have been much known\r\nuntil his fortieth or fiftieth year. In 1810 he first founded an\r\nindustrial school of art, which attracted numbers of young people. To\r\nprovide them with a compendium of instruction in drawing he published in\r\n1810 the first volume of his _Mangwa_. From that time he was recognised\r\nas the head of a school. When his fame began to spread he changed his\r\nresidence almost every month to protect himself from troublesome\r\nvisitors. And just as often did he alter his name. Even that under which\r\nhe became famous in Europe is only a pseudonym, like "Gavarni": amongst\r\nvarious _noms de guerre_ it was that which he bore the longest and by\r\nwhich he was definitely recognised.\r\n\r\nAs a painter he was only active in his youth. The achievement of his\r\nlife is not his pictures, but a magnificent series of illustrated books,\r\na life\'s work richer than that of any of his compatriots. Like Titian\r\nand Corot, fate had predestined him to reach a very great age without\r\never growing old.\r\n\r\n"From my sixth year," he writes in the preface to one of his books, "I\r\nhad a perfect mania for drawing every object that I saw. When I had\r\nreached my fiftieth year I published a vast quantity of drawings; but I\r\nam unsatisfied with all that I have produced before my seventieth year.\r\nAt seventy-three I had some understanding of the form and real nature of\r\nbirds, fish, and plants. At eighty I hope to have made further progress,\r\nand at ninety to have discovered the ultimate foundation of things. In\r\nmy hundredth year I shall rise to yet higher spheres unknown, and in my\r\nhundred and tenth, every stroke, every point, and in short everything\r\nthat comes from my hand will be alive." Hokusai certainly did not reach\r\nso great an age as that. He died at eighty-nine, on 13th April 1849, and\r\nis buried in the temple at Yeddo. During the period between 1815 and\r\n1845 he published about eighty great works, altogether over five hundred\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n"I rose from my seat at the window, where I had idled the whole day long\r\n... softly, softly.... Then I was up and away.... I saw the countless\r\ngreen leaves tremble in the densely embowered tops of the trees; I\r\nwatched the flaky clouds in the blue sky, collecting fantastically into\r\nshapes torn and multiform.... I sauntered here and there carelessly,\r\nwithout aim or volition.... Now I crossed the Bridge of Apes and\r\nlistened as the echo repeated the cry of the wild cranes.... Now I was\r\nin the cherry-grove of Owari.... Through the mists shifting along the\r\ncoast of Miho I descried the famous pines of Suminoye.... Now I stood\r\ntrembling upon the Bridge of Kameji and looked down in astonishment at\r\nthe gigantic Fuki plants.... Then the roar of the dizzy waterfall of Ono\r\nresounded in my ear. A shudder ran through me.... It was only a dream\r\nwhich I dreamed, lying in bed near my window with this book of pictures\r\nby the master as a cushion beneath my head."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KIYONAGA.   LADIES BOATING.]\r\n\r\nIn these words a learned Japanese has indicated the great range of\r\nsubject, the unspeakably rich material of the works of the master. By\r\npreference he leads us to the work-places of artisans, to woodcarvers,\r\nsmiths, workers in metal, dyers, weavers, and embroiderers. Then come\r\nthe pleasures of the nobility, who are displayed in their refinement,\r\nreserve, and dignity; the country-folk at their daily avocations, or\r\nmaking merry upon holidays; the fantastic shapes of fabulous animals and\r\ndemons, who figure in the life of Japanese national heroes, mighty with\r\nthe sword; apparitions, drunken men, wrestlers, street figures of every\r\nconceivable description, mythical reptiles, snow-clad mountain tops,\r\nwaving rice-fields lashed by the wind, woodland glens, strange gateways\r\nof rock, far views over waters with cliffs clothed with pine.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of those works which contain landscapes exclusively\r\nare the views, published in three volumes in 1834-36, of the mountain of\r\nFuji, the great volcano rising close by Yeddo, and from old time playing\r\na part in the works of Japanese landscape painters. In Hokusai\'s book\r\nthe cone of the mountain is sometimes seen rising clear in a cloudless\r\nsky, whilst it is sometimes shrouded by clouds of various shapes. Its\r\nbeautiful outline glimmers through the meshes of a net, through the\r\nspindrift of snow falling in great flakes, or through a curtain of rain\r\nsplashing vertically down. It rises from misty valleys coloured by the\r\nrays of the evening sun, or is reflected--itself out of sight--in the\r\nsmooth surface of a lake, upon the reedy shores of which the wild geese\r\ncackle, or it stands in ghostly outlines against the night sky flooded\r\nwith silver moonlight. Summer breezes and winter storms drive over it,\r\nrattling showers of hail, lashed by the wind, or light falls of snow\r\ndescend round it. In spring the blossoms of peach and plum-trees flutter\r\nto the earth, like swarms of white and rosy butterflies. Only famished\r\nwolves or dragons, which popular superstition has located in the\r\nmountain of Fuji, occasionally animate the grandiose solitude of the\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\n"Never," says Gonse, "has a more dexterous hand rested upon paper. It is\r\nimpossible to study his plates without an excited feeling of pleasure,\r\nfor they are absolute perfection, the highest that Japanese art has\r\nproduced in freshness, brilliancy, life, and originality. Hokusai\'s\r\ncapacity of giving the impression of relief and colour with a stroke of\r\nthe brush has nothing like it except in Rembrandt, Callot, and Goya.\r\nMen, animals, landscapes, and everything in his drawings are reduced to\r\ntheir simplest expression. Groups are seen in motion, priests in\r\nprocession, soldiers on the march, and often a single stroke is\r\nsufficient to render an individual or create the impression of life and\r\nmovement. Every plate is a masterpiece of coloured woodcut engraving, of\r\nsingular flavour in colour, delightful in its gravely harmonised chord\r\nof golden yellow, faded green, and fiery red, to which are sometimes\r\nadded golden, silvern, and other metallic tones."\r\n\r\nAfter the beginning of the sixties Paris came under the captivating\r\ninfluence of Japan. And there is no doubt that as the English influenced\r\nthe landscape painters of Fontainebleau, the Venetians Delacroix, and\r\nthe Neapolitan masters Courbet and Ribot, the newest phase of French\r\nart, which took its departure from Manet, was inaugurated by the\r\nenthusiasm for things Japanese. From the moment when the peculiar\r\nisolation of Japan was ended by the breaking up of the Japanese feudal\r\nstate, Paris was flooded by splendid works of Japanese art. A painter\r\ndiscovered amongst the mass of articles newly arrived albums, colour\r\nprints, and pictures. Their drawing, colouring, and composition deviated\r\nfrom everything hitherto accounted as art, and yet the \xc3\xa6sthetic\r\ncharacter of these works was too artistic to permit of any one smiling\r\nover them as curiosities. Whether the discoverer was Alfred Stevens or\r\nDiaz, Fortuny, James Tissot, or Alphonse Legros, the enthusiasm for the\r\nJapanese swept over the studios like a storm. The artistic world never\r\nwearied of admiring the capricious ability of these compositions, the\r\nastonishing power of drawing, the fineness in tone, the originality of\r\npictorial effect, nor of wondering at the refined simplicity of the\r\nmeans by which these results were achieved. Japanese art made itself\r\nfelt by its fresh and tender charm, its creative opulence, its lightness\r\nand delicacy of observation; it arrested attention because directness,\r\nunfailing tact, and inherent distinction were of the essence of its\r\nconception; and it was recognised as the production of a nation of\r\nartists combining the subtilised taste of an originally refined\r\ncivilisation with the freshness of feeling peculiar to primitive people.\r\nColour prints, now to be had for a few francs at every bazaar, were\r\nbought at the highest figures. Every new consignment was awaited with\r\nfeverish impatience. Old ivory, enamel, porcelain and embellished\r\npottery, bronzes and wood and lacquer-work, ornamented stuffs,\r\nembroidered silks, albums, books of wood-cuts, and knick-knacks were\r\nscarcely unpacked in the shop before they found their way into the\r\nstudios of artists and the libraries of scholars. In a short time great\r\ncollections of the artistic productions of Japan passed into the hands\r\nof the painters Manet, James Tissot, Whistler, Fantin-Latour, Degas,\r\nCarolus Duran, and Monet; of the engravers Bracquemond and Jules\r\nJacquemart; of the authors Edmond and Jules de Goncourt, Champfleury,\r\nPhilippe Burty, and Zola; and of the manufacturers Barbedienne and\r\nChristofle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARUNOBU.   A PAIR OF LOVERS.]\r\n\r\nThe International Exhibition of 1867 brought Japan still more into\r\nfashion, and from this year must be dated the peculiar influence of the\r\nWest upon the East and the East upon the West. The Japanese came over to\r\nstudy at the European polytechnic institutes, universities, and military\r\nacademies. On the other hand, we became the pupils of the Japanese in\r\nart. Even during the course of the Exhibition a group of artists and\r\ncritics founded a Japanese society of the "Jinglar," which met every\r\nweek in S\xc3\xa8vres at the house of Solon, the director of the manufactory.\r\nThey used a Japanese dinner-service, designed by Bracquemond, and\r\neverything except the napkins, cigars, and ash-trays was Japanese. One\r\nof the members, Dr. Zacharias Astruc, published in _L\'\xc3\x89tendard_ a series\r\nof articles upon "The Empire of the Rising Sun," which made a great\r\nsensation. Soon afterwards the Parisian theatres brought out Japanese\r\nballets and fairy plays. Ernest d\'Hervilly wrote his Japanese piece _La\r\nBelle Sa\xc3\xafnara_, which Lem\xc3\xa8re printed for him in Japanese fashion and\r\npaged from right to left, giving it a yellow cover designed by\r\nBracquemond. A Japanese ballet was performed at the opera, and a\r\nJapanese turn was given to the toilettes of women.\r\n\r\nFor painters Japanese art was a revelation. Here was uttered the word\r\nthat hovered on so many lips, and that no one had dared to pronounce.\r\nWith what a fleeting touch, and yet with what precision, with what\r\nincomparable sureness, lightness, and grace, was everything carried out.\r\nHow intuitive and spontaneous, how imaginative and how full of\r\nsuggestion, how effortless and how rich in surprises, was this strange\r\nart. How happily was industry united with caprice, and nonchalance with\r\nendeavour at the highest finish. How suggestive was this disregard for\r\nsymmetry, this piquant method of introducing a flower, an insect, a\r\nfrog, or a bird here and there, merely as a pictorial spot in the\r\npicture. How the Japanese understood the art of expressing much with few\r\nmeans, where the Europeans toiled with a great expenditure of means to\r\nexpress little.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly have been an exceedingly false move if a direct\r\nimitation of the Japanese had been thought of. Japanese art is the\r\nproduct of a sensuous people, and European art that of intellectual\r\nnations. The latter is greater and more serious; it is nobler, and it\r\nreaches heights of expression not attained by the grotesque and terrible\r\ndistortions and the morbidly droll or melancholy outbursts of sentiment\r\nknown to the Japanese. Our imagination is alien to that of these\r\nchildren of the sensuous world, who quake and tremble for joy, horrify\r\nthemselves with their masks, and pass from convulsive laughter to sheer\r\nterror, and from the shudder of hallucination to ecstatic bliss. Had\r\nJapanese art been coarsely transposed by imitators it would have led to\r\ncaricature.\r\n\r\nBut if its poetics were little suitable for Europe in the specialised\r\ncase, they nevertheless contained general laws better fitted for modern\r\nart than those which had been hitherto borrowed from Greece. All arts,\r\nmusic as well as poetry, were then striving for the dissolution of\r\nsimple, tyrannical rhythms. The recurrence of unyielding measures beaten\r\nout with unwavering repetition no longer corresponded with the\r\ncomplicated, neurotic emotions of the new age. In painting, likewise,\r\nexertions were being made to burst the old shell, and a style was sought\r\nafter for the treatment of modern life which had been violently handled\r\nin the effort to force it to fit the Procrustean bed of traditional\r\nrules. Then came the Japanese with their astonishing, rapid, and\r\npictorial sketches, and revealed a new method for the interpretation of\r\nnature. At a time when the symmetrical balance of lines, borrowed from\r\nthe works of the Renaissance masters, became wearisome in its monotony,\r\nthey taught a much freer architecture of form, and one which was broken\r\nby charming caprices. Where there had been rhythm, tension, clarity,\r\nlargeness, and quietude in the old European painting, there was in them\r\na nervous freedom, an artful carelessness, and life and charm. Art was\r\nconcealed beneath the fancy shown in their facile construction, which\r\nseemed to have been improvised by nature herself. An artistic method of\r\ndeviating from geometrical arrangement, freedom of distribution,\r\nunforced and unsymmetrical structure, in the place of balance and\r\nconstruction according to rules, were learnt from the Japanese in the\r\nmatter of composition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOYOKUMI.   NOCTURNAL REVERIE.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, they threw light upon what had been flat and trivial\r\nin Courbet\'s realism. These spirited narrators never told a story for\r\nthe sake of telling it; they never painted to give a prosaic copy of\r\nsome particle of reality. They liberated European painting from the\r\nheaviness of matter, and rendered it tender and delicate. They taught\r\nthat art of not saying everything, which says so much, the method of\r\ncompendious drawing, the secret of expanding distance by a special\r\ntreatment of lines, the touch thrown rapidly in, the unforeseen, the\r\nsurprise, the fleeting hint, the way of increasing effect by the\r\nincompletion of motive, the suggestion of the whole by a part. Artists\r\nlearnt from them another manner of drawing and modelling, a manner of\r\ngiving the impression of the object without the need for the whole of it\r\nbeing executed, so that one knows that it is there only through one\'s\r\nknowledge. They brought in the taste for pithy sketches dealing only\r\nwith essentials, the consciousness of the endless catalogue of what may\r\nbe contained--in life, reality, and fancy--by one fluent outline. They\r\nintroduced the preference for perspective bird\'s-eye views, the\r\ndisposition to throw groups, dense masses, and crowds more into the\r\ndistance, and render them more animated and vivid by a relief of the\r\nforeground, which (though confirmed by photography) is apparently\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Japan on colouring is just as visible as upon\r\ncomposition and drawing. It had been clearly shown in Courbet\'s pictures\r\nof artisans that the rules of the Bolognese school, with their brown\r\nsauce and their red shadows, could not possibly be applied to objects in\r\nthe open air. It was therefore necessary to discover a new principle of\r\ncolour for modern subjects, a principle by which oil-painting would be\r\ndivested of its oil, and light and air would come to their rights. It\r\nwas seen from the works of the painters of Nippon that it was not\r\nabsolutely necessary to paint brown to be a painter. They taught a new\r\nmethod of seeing things, opened the eyes to the changing play of the\r\nphenomena of light, the fugitive nature and constant mutability of which\r\nhad up to this time seemed to mock at every rendering. The softness of\r\ntheir bright harmonies was studied and artistically transposed.\r\n\r\nThese are the points in which Japanese art has had a revolutionary\r\neffect upon the development of European. Each one of those who at that\r\ntime belonged to the Society of the Jinglar has had more or less\r\nexperience of its influence. Alfred Stevens owes to it certain\r\ndelicacies of colouring; Whistler, his exquisite refinement of tone and\r\nhis capriciously artistic method in the treatment of landscape; Degas,\r\nhis fantastic and free grouping, his unrivalled audacities of\r\ncomposition. Manet especially became now the artist to whom history does\r\nhonour, and Louis Gonse tells a story with a very characteristic touch\r\nof the first exhibition of the _Ma\xc3\xaetres impressionistes_. He went there,\r\ncoming from the official Salon in the company of a Japanese, and, while\r\nthe French public declared the fresh brightness of the pictures to be\r\nuntrue and barbaric, the son of sacred Nippon, accustomed from youth to\r\nsee nature in light, airy tones without a yellow coating of varnish,\r\nsaid: "Over there I was in an exhibition of oil-pictures, here I feel as\r\nif I were entering a flowery garden. What strikes me is the animation of\r\nthese figures, and the feeling is one I have never had elsewhere in your\r\npicture exhibitions."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE IMPRESSIONISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Impressionists dates from an exhibition in Paris which was got\r\nup at Nadar\'s in 1871. The catalogue contained a great deal about\r\nimpressions--for instance, "_Impression de mon pot au feu_,"\r\n"_Impression d\'un chat qui se prom\xc3\xa8ne_." In his criticism Claretie\r\nsummed up the impressions and spoke of the _Salon des Impressionistes_.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the movement, however, came about the middle of the\r\nsixties, and Zola was the first to champion the new artists with his\r\ntrenchant pen. Assuming the name of his later hero Claude, he\r\ncontributed in 1866 to _L\'\xc3\x89v\xc3\xa9nement_, under the title _Mon Salon_, that\r\narticle which swamped the office with such a flood of indignant letters\r\nand occasioned such a secession of subscribers that the proprietor of\r\nthe paper, the sage and admirable M. de Villemessant, felt himself\r\nobliged to give the naturalist critic an anti-naturalistic colleague in\r\nthe person of M. Th\xc3\xa9odore Pelloquet. In these reviews of the Salon,\r\ncollected in 1879 in the volume _Mes Haines_, and in the essay upon\r\n_Courbet, the Painter of Realism_--Courbet, the already recognised\r\n"master of Ornans "--those theories are laid down which Lantier and his\r\nfriends announced at a later date in _L\'Oeuvre_. Then the architect\r\nDubiche, one of the members of the young _Boh\xc3\xa8me_, dreamed in a spirit\r\nof presage of a new architecture. "With passionate gestures he demanded\r\nand insisted upon the formula for the architecture of this democracy,\r\nthat work in stone which should give expression to it, a building in\r\nwhich it should feel itself at home, something strong and forcible,\r\nsimple and great, something already proclaimed in our railway stations\r\nand our markets in the grace and power of their iron girders, but\r\npurified and made beautiful, declaring the largeness of our conquests."\r\nA few years went by, and then the Paris Centenary Exhibition provided\r\nthat something, though it was not in monumental stone. The great\r\nedifices were fashioned of glass and iron, and the mighty railway\r\nbuildings were their forerunners. The enormous engine-rooms which gave\r\nspace for thousands and the Eiffel Tower announced this new\r\narchitecture. And as Dubiche prophesied a new architecture, so did\r\nClaude prophesy a new painting. "Sun and open air and bright and\r\nyouthful painting are what we need. Let the sun come in and render\r\nobjects as they appear under the illumination of broad daylight." In\r\nZola Claude Lantier is the martyr of this new style. He is scorned,\r\nderided, avoided, and cast out. His best picture is smuggled, through\r\ngrace and mercy, into the Exhibition by a friend upon the hanging\r\ncommittee as a _charit\xc3\xa9_. But, ten years after, these new doctrines had\r\npenetrated all the studios of Paris and of Europe like germs borne in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nThe artistic ideas of Claude Lantier were given to Zola by his friend\r\n_\xc3\x89douard Manet_, the father of Impressionism, and in that way the\r\ncreator of the newest form of art. Manet appeared for the first time in\r\n1862. In 1865, when the Committee of the Salon gave up a few secondary\r\nrooms to the rejected, the first of his pictures which made any\r\nsensation were to be seen--a "Scourging of Christ" and a picture of a\r\ngirl with a cat resting--both invariably surrounded by a dense circle of\r\nthe scornful. Forty years before, the first works of the Romanticists,\r\nwhose doctrine was likewise scoffed at in the formula _Le laid c\'est le\r\nbeau_, had called forth a similar outcry against the want of taste\r\ncommon to them all. A generation later people laughed at "The Funeral in\r\nOrnans," and now the same derision was directed against Manet, who\r\ncompleted Courbet\'s work. His pictures were held to be a practical joke\r\nwhich the painter was playing upon the public, the most unheard of farce\r\nthat had ever been painted. If any one had declared that these works\r\nwould give the impulse to a revolution in art, people would have turned\r\ntheir backs upon him or thought that he was jesting. "Criticism treated\r\nManet," wrote Zola, "as a kind of buffoon who put out his tongue for the\r\namusement of street boys." The rage against "The Scourging of Christ"\r\nwent so far that the picture had to be protected by special precautions\r\nfrom the assaults of sticks and umbrellas.\r\n\r\nBut the matter took a somewhat different aspect when, five years\r\nafterwards, from twenty to thirty more recent pictures were exhibited\r\ntogether in Manet\'s studio. Whether it was because the aims of the\r\npainter had become clearer in the meanwhile, or because his works\r\nsuffered less from the proximity of others, they made an impression, and\r\nthat although they represented nothing in the least adventurous and\r\nsensational. Life-size figures, light and almost without shadow, rowed\r\nover blue water, hung out white linen, watered green flower-pots, and\r\nleant against grey walls. The light colours placed immediately beside\r\neach other had a bizarre effect on the eye accustomed to chiaroscuro.\r\nThe eye, which, like the human spirit, has its habitudes, and believes\r\nthat it always sees nature as she is painted, was irritated by these\r\ndelicately chosen tone-values which seemed to it arbitrary, by these\r\nnovel harmonies which it took for discords. Nevertheless the clarity of\r\nthe pictures made a striking effect, and something of "Manet\'s sun"\r\nlingered in the memory. People still laughed, only not so loud, and they\r\ngave Manet credit for having the courage of his convictions. "A\r\nremarkable circumstance has to be recorded. A young painter has followed\r\nhis personal impressions quite ingenuously, and has painted a few things\r\nwhich are not altogether in accord with the principles taught in the\r\nschools. In this way he has executed pictures which have been a source\r\nof offence to eyes accustomed to other paintings. But now, instead of\r\nabusing the young artist through thick and thin, we must be first clear\r\nas to why our eyes have been offended, and whether they ought to have\r\nbeen." With these words criticism began to take Manet seriously. Charles\r\nEphrussi and Duranty, besides Zola, came forward as his first literary\r\nchampions in the press. "Manet is bold" was now the phrase used about\r\nhim in public. The Impressionists took the salon by storm. And Manet\'s\r\nbright and radiant sun was seen to be a better thing than the brown\r\nsauce of the Bolognese. It was as if a strong power had suddenly\r\nderanged the focus of opinion in all the studios, and Manet\'s victory\r\nbrought the same salvation to French art as that of Delacroix had done\r\nforty years before and that of Courbet ten years before. _Manet et\r\nmanebit._ Delacroix, Courbet, and Manet are the three great names of\r\nmodern French painting, the names of the men who gave it the most\r\ndecisive impulses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xc3\x89DOUARD MANET.]\r\n\r\n\xc3\x89douard Manet, _le ma\xc3\xaetre impressioniste_, was born in 1832, in the Rue\r\nBonaparte, exactly opposite the \xc3\x89cole des Beaux-Arts, and his life was\r\nquietly and simply spent, without passion and excitement, unusual\r\nevents, or sanguinary battles. At sixteen, having passed through the\r\n_Coll\xc3\xa8ge Rollin_, he entered the navy with the permission of his\r\nparents, and made a voyage to Rio de Janeiro, which was accomplished\r\nwithout any incident of interest, without shipwreck or any one being\r\ndrowned. With his cheerful, even temperament he looked on the boundless\r\nsea and satiated his eyes with the marvellous spectacle of waves and\r\nhorizon, never to forget it. The luminous sky was spread before him, the\r\ngreat ocean rocked and sported around, revealing colours other than he\r\nhad seen in the Salon. On his return he gave himself up entirely to\r\npainting. He is said to have been a slight, pale, delicate, and refined\r\nyoung man when he became a pupil of Couture in 1851, almost at the same\r\ntime as Feuerbach. Nearly six years he remained with the master of "The\r\nDecadent Romans," without a suspicion of how he was to find his way, and\r\neven after he had left the studio he was still pursued by the shade of\r\nCouture; he worked without knowing very well what he really wanted. Then\r\nhe travelled, visiting Germany, Cassel, Dresden, Prague, Vienna, and\r\nMunich, where he copied the portrait of Rembrandt in the Pinakothek; and\r\nthen he saw Florence, Rome, and Venice. Under the influence of the\r\nNeapolitan and Flemish artists, to whom Ribot, Courbet, and Stevens\r\npointed at the time, he gradually became a painter. His first picture,\r\n"The Child with Cherries," painted in 1859, reveals the influence of\r\nBrouwer. In 1861 he exhibited, for the first time, the "double portrait"\r\nof his parents, for which he received honourable mention, although--or\r\nbecause--the picture was entirely painted in the old Bolognese style.\r\nThese works are only of interest because they make it possible to see\r\nthe rapidity with which Manet learnt to understand his craft with the\r\naid of the old masters, and the sureness and energy with which he\r\nfollowed, from the very beginning, the realistic tendency initiated by\r\nCourbet. "The Nymph Surprised," in 1862, was a medley of reminiscences\r\nfrom Jordaens, Tintoretto, and Delacroix. His "Old Musician," executed\r\nwith diligence but trivial in its realism, had the appearance of being a\r\ntolerable Courbet. Then he made--not at first in Madrid, which he only\r\nknew later, but in the Louvre--the eventful discovery of another old\r\nmaster, not yet known in all his individuality to the master of Ornans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  MANET.   THE FIFER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  MANET.   THE GUITARERO.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Faure, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nAt the great Manchester Exhibition of 1857 Velasquez had been revealed\r\nto the English; in the beginning of the sixties he was discovered by the\r\nFrench. William Stirling\'s biography of Velasquez was translated into\r\nFrench by G. Brunet, and provided with a _Catalogue raisonn\xc3\xa9_ by W.\r\nB\xc3\xbcrger. The works of Charles Blanc, Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier, and Paul Lefort\r\nappeared, and in a short time Velasquez, of whom the world outside\r\nMadrid had hitherto known little, was in artistic circles in Paris a\r\nfamiliar and frequently cited personality, who began not only to occupy\r\nthe attention of the historians of art, but of artists also. Couture was\r\nin the habit of saying to his pupils that Velasquez had not understood\r\nthe orchestration of tones, that he had an inclination to monochrome,\r\nand that he had never comprehended the nature of colour. From the\r\nbeginning of the sixties France came under the sway of that serious\r\nfeeling for colour known to the great Spaniard, and Manet was his first\r\nenthusiastic pupil. Certain of his single figures against a pearl-grey\r\nbackground--"The Fifer," "The Guitarero," "The Bull-fighter wounded to\r\nDeath"--were the decisive works in which, with astonishing talent, he\r\ndeclared himself as the pupil of Velasquez. W. B\xc3\xbcrger praised Velasquez\r\nas _le peintre le plus peintre qui f\xc3\xbbt jamais_. As regards the\r\nnineteenth century, the same may be said of Manet. Only Frans Hals and\r\nVelasquez had these eminent pictorial qualities. In the way in which the\r\nblack velvet dress, the white silk band, and the red flag were painted\r\nin the toreador picture, there was a feeling for beauty which bore\r\nwitness to the finest understanding of the great Spaniard. In his\r\n"Angels at the Tomb of Christ" he has sought, as little as did Velasquez\r\nin his picture of the Epiphany, to introduce any trace of heavenly\r\nexpression into the faces, but as a piece of painting it takes its place\r\namongst the best religious pictures of the century. His "Bon Bock"--a\r\nportrait of the engraver Belot, a stout jovial man smoking a pipe as he\r\nsits over a glass of beer--is one of those likenesses which stamp\r\nthemselves upon the memory like the "Hille Bobbe" of Frans Hals. "Faure\r\nas Hamlet" stands out from the vacant light grey background like the\r\n"Truhan Pablillos" of Velasquez. The doublet and mantle are of black\r\nvelvet, the mantle lined with rose-coloured silk; and the toilette is\r\ncompleted by a broad black hat with a large black feather. He seems as\r\nthough he had just stepped to the footlights, and stands there with his\r\nlegs apart, the mantle thrown over the left arm, and his right hand\r\nclosing upon his sword. The cool harmony of black, white, grey, and\r\nrose-colour makes an uncommonly refined effect. Manet has the rich\r\nartistic methods of Velasquez in a measure elsewhere only attained by\r\nRaeburn, and as the last of these studies he has created in his "Enfant\r\n\xc3\xa0 l\'\xc3\x89p\xc3\xa9e" a work which--speaking without profanity--might have been\r\nsigned by the great Spaniard himself. In the beginning of the sixties,\r\nwhen he gave a separate exhibition of his works, Courbet is said to have\r\nexclaimed upon entering, "Nothing but Spaniards!"\r\n\r\nBut even this following of the Spaniards indicated an advance upon\r\nCourbet; it meant the triumph over brown sauce and a closer\r\napproximation to truth. For, amongst all the old masters, Velasquez and\r\nFrans Hals--who greatly resemble each other in this respect--are the\r\nsimplest and most natural in their colouring; they are not idealists in\r\ncolour like Titian, Paul Veronese, and Rubens, nor do they labour upon\r\nthe tone of their pictures like the Dutch "little masters" and Chardin.\r\nThey paint their pictures in the broad and common light of day. Their\r\nflesh-tint is truer than the juicy tint of the Venetians, and the fiery\r\nred of Rubens, with his shining reflections. Beside Velasquez, as Justi\r\nsays, the colouring of Titian seems conventional, that of Rembrandt\r\nfantastic, and that of Rubens is tinged with something which is not\r\nnatural. Or, as a contemporary of Velasquez expressed himself:\r\n"Everything else, old and new, is painting; Velasquez alone is truth."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANET.   LE BON BOCK.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Faure, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nThus the difference between the youthful works of Manet and those of his\r\npredecessor Courbet is the difference between Velasquez and Caravaggio.\r\nOf course, in Manet\'s earliest pictures there were found the broad, dull\r\nred-brown surfaces which characterise the works of the Bolognese and the\r\nNeapolitans. A cool silver tone, a shadowless treatment gleaming in\r\nsilver, has now taken the place of this warm brown sauce. He has the\r\nwhite of Velasquez, his cool subdued rose-colour, his delicate grey\r\nwhich has been so much admired and against which every touch of colour\r\nstands out clear and determined, and that celebrated black of the\r\nSpaniard which is never heavy and dull, but makes such a light and\r\ntransparent effect. What is bright is contrasted with what is bright,\r\nand light colours are placed upon a silvery grey background. The most\r\nperfect modelling and plastic effect is attained without the aid of\r\nstrong contrasts of shadow. Thus he closed his apprenticeship to the old\r\nmasters by being able to see with the eyes of that old master whose\r\nvision was the truest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANET.   A GARDEN IN RUEIL.]\r\n\r\nThis was the point of departure for Manet\'s further development. The\r\nstudy of Velasquez did not merely set him free from sauce; it also\r\nstarted the problem of painting light. He went through a course of\r\ndevelopment similar to that of the old Spaniard himself. When Velasquez\r\npainted his first picture with a popular turn, the "Bacchus," he still\r\nstood upon the ground of the tenebrous painters; he represented an\r\nopen-air scene with the illumination of a closed room. Although the\r\nceremony is taking place in broad daylight, the people seem to be\r\nsitting in a dingy tavern, receiving light from a studio window to the\r\nleft. Ten years afterwards, when he painted "The Smithy of Vulcan," he\r\nhad emancipated himself from this Bolognese tradition, which he spoke of\r\nhenceforward as "a gloomy and horrible style." The deep and sharply\r\ncontrasted shadows have vanished, and daylight has conquered the light\r\nof the cellar. The great equestrian portraits which followed gave Mengs\r\noccasion to remark, even a hundred years ago, that Velasquez was the\r\nfirst who understood how to paint what is "ambiant," the air filling the\r\nvacuum between objects. And at the end of his life he solved the final\r\nproblem in "The Women Spinning." In the "Bacchus" might be found the\r\ntreatment of an open-air scene in the key of sauce, but here was the\r\nglistening of light in an interior. The sun quivers over silken stuffs,\r\nfalls upon the dazzling necks of women, plays through coal-black\r\nCastilian locks, renders one thing plastically distinct and another\r\npictorially vague, dissolves corporeality, and lends surface the\r\nrounding of life. Contours touched with the brightness of light surround\r\nthe heads of the girls at work. The shadows are not warm brown but cool\r\ngrey, and the tints of reflected light play from one object to another.\r\n\r\nTwo remarkable pictures of 1863 and 1865 show that Manet had grasped the\r\nproblem and was endeavouring in a tentative way to give expression to\r\nhis ideas.\r\n\r\nIn one of these, "The Picnic," painted in 1863, there was a stretch of\r\nsward, a few trees, and in the background a river in which a woman was\r\nmerrily splashing in her chemise; in the foreground were seated two\r\nyoung men in frock-coats opposite another woman, who has just come out\r\nof the water and been drying herself. Needless to say, this picture was\r\nrejected as something unprecedented, by the committee, which included\r\nIngres, L\xc3\xa9on Cogniet, Robert Fleury, and Hippolyte Flandrin. Eug\xc3\xa8ne\r\nDelacroix was the only one in its favour. So Manet was relegated to the\r\n_Salon des Refus\xc3\xa9s_, where Bracquemond, Legros, Whistler, and Harpignies\r\nwere hung beside him. This Exhibition was held in the Industrial Hall,\r\nand the public went through a narrow little door from one gallery to the\r\nother. Half Paris was bewildered and discomposed by these works of the\r\nrejected; even Napoleon III and the Empress Eug\xc3\xa9nie ostentatiously\r\nturned their backs upon Manet\'s picture when they visited the Salon.\r\nThis naked woman made a scandal. How shocking! A woman without the\r\nslightest stitch of clothes between two gentlemen in their frock-coats!\r\nIn the Louvre, indeed, there were about fifty Venetian paintings with\r\nmuch the same purport. Every manual of art refers to "The Family," as it\r\nis called, and the "Ages of Life" of Giorgione, in which nude and\r\nclothed figures are moving in a landscape and placed ingenuously beside\r\neach other. But that a painter should claim for a modern artist the\r\nright of painting for the joy of what is purely pictorial was a\r\nphenomenon that had never been encountered before. The public searched\r\nfor something obscene, and they found it; but for Manet the whole\r\npicture was only a technical experiment: the nude woman in front was\r\nonly there because the painter wanted to observe the play of the sun and\r\nthe reflections of the foliage upon naked flesh; the woman in her\r\nchemise merely owed her existence to the circumstance of her charming\r\noutline making such a delightful patch of white amid the green meadows.\r\nManet for the first time touched the problem which Madox Brown had\r\nthrown out in his "Work" ten years before in England, though for the\r\npresent he did so with no greater success: the sunbeams glanced no\r\ndoubt, but they were heavy and opaque; the sky was bright, but without\r\natmosphere. As yet there is nothing of the Manet who belongs to history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  MANET.   THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE "KEARSARGE" AND "ALABAMA."]\r\n\r\nThe celebrated "Olympia" of 1865, now to be found in the Luxembourg, was\r\npainted during this stage in his development: it represents a neurotic,\r\nan\xc3\xa6mic creature, who stretches out, pale and sickly, her meagre nudity\r\nupon white linen, with a purring cat at her feet; whilst a negress in a\r\nred dress draws back the curtain, offering her a bouquet. With this\r\npicture--no one can tell why--the definite battles over Impressionism\r\nbegan. The critics who talked about obscenity were not consistent,\r\nbecause Titian\'s pictures of Venus with her female attendant, the little\r\ndog, and the youth sitting upon the edge of the bed, are not usually\r\nheld to be obscene. But it is nevertheless difficult to find in this\r\nflatly modelled body, with its hard black outlines, those artistic\r\nqualities which Zola discovered in it. The picture has nothing whatever\r\nof Titian in it, but it may almost be said to have something of Cranach.\r\n"The Picnic" and "Olympia" have both only an historical interest as the\r\nfirst works in which the artist trusted his own eyes, refusing to look\r\nthrough any one\'s spectacles. Feeling that he would come to nothing if\r\nhe continued to study nature through the medium of an old master, he had\r\nto render some real thing just as it appeared to him when he was not\r\nlooking into the mirror of old pictures. He tried to forget what he had\r\nstudied in galleries, the tricks of art which he had learnt with\r\nCouture, and the famous pictures he had seen. In his earlier works there\r\nhad been a far-fetched refinement and a delicacy taken from the old\r\nmasters, but "The Picnic" and "Olympia" are simpler and more\r\nindependent. In both he was already an "Impressionist," true to his\r\npersonal vision, though he could not entirely express the new language\r\nthat hovered upon his lips. He had tried both to rid himself of\r\nCourbet\'s brown sauce and of the ivory tone of Bouguereau, and to be\r\njust to local tones through simple and independent observation; in his\r\n"Picnic" he had painted the trees green, the earth yellow, and the sky\r\ngrey, and in "Olympia" the bed white and the body of the woman\r\nflesh-colour. But he was as little successful as the pre-Raphaelites in\r\nbringing the local tones into full harmony. This is the step which Manet\r\nmade in advance of the pre-Raphaelites: after he had emancipated himself\r\nfrom the conventional brown and ivory scheme of tone, and had been for a\r\ntime, like the pre-Raphaelites, true although hard, he attained that\r\nharmony which hitherto had been either not reached by artistic means or\r\nnot reached at all, by strict observation of the medium by which nature\r\nproduces her harmonies--light. As the air, the pervasive atmosphere,\r\nrenders nature everywhere harmonious and refined in colour, so it\r\nforthwith became for the artist the means of reaching that great harmony\r\nwhich is the object of all pictorial endeavour, and which had never\r\npreviously been reached except through some mannerism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  MANET.   BOATING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  MANET.   A BAR AT THE FOLIES-BERG\xc3\x88RES.]\r\n\r\nThis movement, so historically memorable, when Manet discovered the sun\r\nand the fine fluid of the atmosphere, was shortly before 1870. Not long\r\nbefore the declaration of war he was in the country, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Paris, staying with his friend de Nittis; but he\r\ncontinued to work as though he were at home, only his studio was here\r\nthe pleasure-ground. Here one day he sat in full sunlight, placed his\r\nmodel amid the flowers of the turf, and began to paint. The result was\r\n"The Garden," now in the possession of Madame de Nittis. The young wife\r\nof the Italian painter is reclining in an easy-chair, between her\r\nhusband, who is lying on the grass, and her child asleep in its cradle.\r\nEvery flower is fresh and bright upon the fragrant sward. The green of\r\nthe stretch of grass is luminous, and everything is bathed in soft,\r\nbright atmosphere; the leaves cast their blue shadows upon the yellow\r\ngravel path. "Plein-air" made its entry into painting.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 his activity had to be interrupted. He entered a company of\r\nVolunteers consisting chiefly of artists and men of letters, and in\r\nDecember he became a lieutenant in the Garde Nationale, where he had\r\nMeissonier as his colonel. The pictures, therefore, in which he was\r\nentirely Manet belong exclusively to the period following 1870.\r\n\r\nFrom this time his great problem was the sun, the glow of daylight, the\r\ntremor of the air upon the earth basking in light. He became a natural\r\nphilosopher who could never satisfy himself, studying the effect of\r\nlight and determining with the observation of a man of science how the\r\natmosphere alters the phenomena of colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  MANET.   SPRING: JEANNE.]\r\n\r\nIn tender, virginal, light grey tones, never seen before, he depicted,\r\nin fourteen pictures exhibited at a dealer\'s, the luxury and grace of\r\nParis, the bright days of summer and _soir\xc3\xa9es_ flooded with gaslight,\r\nthe faded features of the fallen maiden and the refined _chic_ of the\r\nwoman of the world. There was to be seen "Nana," that marvel of\r\naudacious grace. Laced in a blue silk corset, and otherwise clad merely\r\nin a muslin smock with her feet in pearl-grey stockings, the blond woman\r\nstands at the mirror painting her lips, and carelessly replying to the\r\nwords of a man who is watching her upon the sofa behind. Near it hung\r\nbalcony scenes, fleeting sketches from the skating rink, the _caf\xc3\xa9\r\nconcert_, the _Bal de l\'Op\xc3\xa9ra_, the _d\xc3\xa9jeuner_ scene at P\xc3\xa8re\r\nLathuille\'s, and the "Bar at the Folies-Berg\xc3\xa8res." In one case he has\r\nmade daylight the subject of searching study, in another the artificial\r\nillumination of the footlights. "Music in the Tuileries" reveals a crowd\r\nof people swarming in an open, sunny place. Every figure was introduced\r\nas a patch of colour, but these patches were alive and this multitude\r\nspoke. One of the best pictures was "Boating"--a craft boldly cut away\r\nin its frame, after the manner of the Japanese, and seated in it a\r\nyoung lady in light blue and a young man in white, their figures\r\ncontrasting finely with the delicate grey of the water and the\r\natmosphere impregnated with moisture. And scattered amongst these\r\npictures there were to be found powerful sea-pieces and charming,\r\npiquant portraits.\r\n\r\nManet had a passion for the world. He was a man with a slight and\r\ngraceful figure, a beard of the colour known as _blond cendr\xc3\xa9_, deep\r\nblue eyes filled with the fire of youth, a refined, clever face,\r\naristocratic hands, and a manner of great urbanity. With his wife, the\r\nhighly cultured daughter of a Dutch musician, he went into the best\r\ncircles of Parisian society, and was popular everywhere for his\r\ntrenchant judgment and his sparkling intellect. His conversation was\r\nvivid and sarcastic. He was famous for his wit _\xc3\xa0 la_ Gavarni. He\r\ndelighted in the delicate perfume of drawing-rooms, the shining\r\ncandle-light at receptions; he worshipped modernity and the piquant\r\n_frou-frou_ of toilettes; he was the first who stood with both feet in\r\nthe world which seemed so inartistic to others. Thus the progress made\r\nin the acquisition of subject and material may be seen even in the\r\noutward appearance of the three pioneers of modern art. Millet in his\r\nportrait stands in wooden shoes, Courbet in his shirt-sleeves; Manet\r\nwears a tall hat and a frock-coat. Millet, the peasant, painted\r\npeasants. Courbet, the democrat from the provinces, gave the rights of\r\ncitizenship to the artisan, but without himself deserting the provinces\r\nand the _bourgeoisie_. He was repelled by everything either\r\ndistinguished or refined. In such matters he could not find the force\r\nand vehemence which were all he sought. Manet, the Parisian and the man\r\nof refinement, gave art the elegance of modern life.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1879 he made the Parisian magistracy the offer of painting\r\nin the session-room of the Town Hall the entire _Ventre de Paris_, the\r\nmarkets, railway stations, lading-places, and public gardens, and\r\nbeneath the ceiling a gallery of the celebrated men of the present time.\r\nHis letter was unanswered, and yet it gave the impulse to all those\r\ngreat pictures of contemporary life painted afterwards in Paris and the\r\nprovinces for the walls of public buildings. In 1880 he received,\r\nthrough the exertions of his friend Antonin Proust, a medal of the\r\nsecond class, the only one ever awarded to him. And the dealer Duret\r\nbegan to buy pictures from him; Durand-Ruel followed suit, and so did M.\r\nFaure, the singer of the Grand Opera, who himself is the owner of\r\nfive-and-thirty Manets. The poor artist did not long enjoy this\r\nrecognition. On 30th April 1883, the varnishing day at the Salon, he\r\ndied from blood-poisoning and the consequences of the amputation of a\r\nleg.\r\n\r\nBut the seed which he had scattered had already thrown out roots. It had\r\ntaken him years to force open the doors of the Salon, but to-day his\r\nname shines in letters of gold upon the fa\xc3\xa7ade of the \xc3\x89cole des\r\nBeaux-Arts as that of the man who has spoken the most decisive final\r\nutterance on behalf of the liberation of modern art. His achievement,\r\nwhich seems to have been an unimportant alteration in the method of\r\npainting, was in reality a renovation in the method of looking at the\r\nworld and a renovation in the method of thinking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mansell Photo._\r\n\r\n  DEGAS.   THE BALLET SCENE IN ROBERT THE DEVIL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEGAS.   THE BALLET IN _DON JUAN_.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEGAS.   A BALLET DANCER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nUp to this time it was only the landscape painters who had emancipated\r\nthemselves from imitation of the gallery tone, and what was done by\r\nCorot in landscape had, logically enough, to be carried out in\r\nfigure-painting likewise; for men and women are encompassed by the air\r\nas much as trees. After the landscape painters of Barbizon had made\r\nevident the vast difference between the light of day and that of a\r\nclosed room in their pictures painted in the open air, the\r\nfigure-painters, if they made any claim to truth of effect, could no\r\nlonger venture to content themselves with the illumination falling upon\r\ntheir models in the studio, when they were painting incidents taking\r\nplace out of doors. Yet even the boldest of the new artists did not set\r\nthemselves free from tradition. Even after they had become independent\r\nin subject and composition they had remained the slaves of the old\r\nmasters in their intuition of colour. Some imitated the Spaniards,\r\nwithout reflecting that Ribera painted his pictures in a small, dark\r\nstudio, and that the cellar-light with which they were illuminated was\r\ntherefore correct, whereas applied, in the present age, to the bright\r\ninteriors of the nineteenth century it was utterly false. Others treated\r\nopen-air scenes as if they were taking place in a ground-floor parlour,\r\nand endeavoured by curtains and shutters to create a light similar to\r\nthat which may be found in old masters and pictures dimmed with age. Or\r\nthe artist painted according to a general recipe and in complete\r\ndefiance of what he saw with his eyes. For instance, an exceedingly\r\ncharacteristic episode is told of the student days of Puvis de\r\nChavannes. Upon a grey, misty day the young artist had painted a nude\r\nfigure. The model appeared enveloped in tender light as by a bright,\r\nsilvery halo. "That\'s the way you see your model?" grumbled Couture\r\nindignantly when he came to correct the picture. Then he mixed together\r\nwhite, cobalt blue, Naples yellow, and vermilion, and turned Puvis de\r\nChavannes\' nude grey figure by a universal recipe into one that was\r\nhighly coloured and warmly luminous--such a figure as an old master\r\nmight perhaps have painted under different conditions of light. With his\r\n"Fiat Lux" Manet uttered a word of redemption that had hovered upon\r\nmany lips. The jurisdiction of galleries was broken now also in regard\r\nto colour; the last remnant of servile dependence upon the mighty dead\r\nwas cast aside; the aims attained by the landscape painters thirty years\r\nbefore were reached in figure-painting likewise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEGAS.   HORSES IN A MEADOW.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEGAS.   DANCING GIRL FASTENING HER SHOE.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps a later age may even come to recognise that Manet made an\r\nadvance upon the old masters in his delicacy and scrupulous analysis of\r\nlight; in that case it will esteem the discovery of tone-values as the\r\nchief acquisition of the nineteenth century, as a conquest such as has\r\nnever been made in painting since the Eycks and Masaccio, since the\r\nestablishment of the theory of perspective. In a treatise commanding all\r\nrespect Hugo Magnus has written of how the sense of colour increased in\r\nthe various periods of the world\'s history; since the appearance of the\r\nImpressionists, verification may be made of yet another advance in this\r\ndirection. The study of tone-values has never been carried on with such\r\nconscientious exactitude, and in regard to truth of atmosphere one is\r\ndisposed to believe that our eyes to-day see and feel things which our\r\nancestors had not yet noticed. The old masters have also touched the\r\nproblem of "truth in painting." It is not merely that the character of\r\ntheir colours often led the Italian tempera and fresco painters to the\r\nmost natural method of treating light. They even occupied themselves in\r\na theoretical way with the question. An old Italian precept declares\r\nthat the painter ought to work in a closed yard beneath an awning, but\r\nshould place his model beneath the open sky. In the frescoes which he\r\npainted in Arezzo in 1480, Piero della Francesca, in particular, pursued\r\nthe problem of _plein-air_ painting with a fine instinct. But love of\r\nthe beautiful and luminous tints, such as the technique of oil-painting\r\nenabled artists to attain at a later date, quickly seduced them from\r\ncarrying out the natural treatment of light in the gradation of colour.\r\nUnder the influence of oil-painting the Italians of the great period,\r\nfrom Leonardo onwards, turned more and more to strong contrasts. And in\r\nspite of Albert Cuyp, even the Dutch landscape painters of the\r\nseventeenth century have seen objects rather in line and form,\r\nplastically, than pictorially in their environment of light and air. The\r\nnineteenth century was the first seriously to attack a problem\r\nwhich--except by Velasquez--had been merely touched upon by the old\r\nschools, but never solved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RENOIR.   SUPPER AT BOUGIVAL.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RENOIR.   THE WOMAN WITH THE FAN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nWhat the masters of Barbizon had done through instinctive genius was\r\nmade the object of scientific study by the Impressionists. The new\r\nschool set up the principle that atmosphere changes the colour of\r\nobjects; for instance, that the colour and outline of a tree painted in\r\na room are completely different from those of the same tree painted upon\r\nthe spot in the open air. As an unqualified rule they claimed that every\r\nincident was to be harmonised with time, place, and light; thus a scene\r\ntaking place out of doors had of necessity to be painted, not within\r\nfour walls, but under the actual illumination of morning, or noon, or\r\nevening, or night. In making this problem the object of detailed and\r\ncareful inquiry the artist came to analyse life, throbbing beneath its\r\nveil of air and light, with more refinement and thoroughness than the\r\nold masters had done. The latter painted light deadened in its fall, not\r\nshining. Oils were treated as an opaque material, colour appeared to be\r\na substance, and the radiance of tinted light was lost through this\r\nmaterial heaviness. Courbet still represented merely the object apart\r\nfrom its environment; he saw things in a plastic way, and not as they\r\nwere, bathed in the atmosphere; his men and women lived in oil, in brown\r\nsauce, and not where it was only possible for them to live--in the air.\r\nEverything he painted he isolated without a thought of atmospheric\r\nsurroundings. Now a complete change of parts was effected: bodies and\r\ncolours were no longer painted, but the shifting power of light under\r\nwhich everything changes form and colour at every moment of the day. The\r\nelder painters in essentials confined light to the surface of objects;\r\nthe new painters believed in its universality, beholding in it the\r\nfather of all life and of the manifold nature of the visible world, and\r\ntherefore of colour also. They no longer painted colours and forms with\r\nlights and cast-shadows, but pellucid light, pouring over forms and\r\ncolours and absorbed and refracted by them. They no longer looked merely\r\nto the particular, but to the whole, no longer saw nothing except\r\ndeadened light and cast-shadows, but the harmony and pictorial charm of\r\na moment of nature considered as such. With a zeal which at times seemed\r\nalmost paradoxical, they proceeded to establish the importance of the\r\nphenomena of light. They discovered that, so far from being gilded,\r\nobjects are silvered by sunlight, and they made every effort to analyse\r\nthe multiplicity of these fine gradations down to their most delicate\r\n_nuances_. They learnt to paint the quiver of tremulous sunbeams\r\nradiating far and wide; they were the lyrical poets of light, which they\r\noften glorified at the expense of what it envelops and causes to live.\r\nAt the service of art they placed a renovated treasury of refined,\r\npurified, and pictorial phases of expression, in which the history of\r\nart records an increase in the human eye of the sense of colour and the\r\npower of perception.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RENOIR.   FISHER CHILDREN BY THE SEA.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RENOIR.   THE WOMAN WITH THE CAT.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nThat light is movement is here made obvious, and that all life is\r\nmovement is just what their art reveals. Courbet was an admirable\r\npainter of plain surfaces. If he had to paint a wall he took it upon his\r\nstrong shoulders and transferred it to his canvas in such a way that a\r\nstonemason might have been deceived. If it was a question of rocks, the\r\nbody of a woman, or the waves of the sea, he began to mix his pigments\r\nthick, laid a firm mass of colour on the canvas, and spread it with a\r\nknife. This spade-work gave him unrivalled truth to nature in\r\nreproducing the surface of hard substances. Rocks, banks, and walls look\r\nas they do in nature, but in the case of moving, indeterminate things\r\nhis power deserts him. His landscapes are painted in a rich, broad, and\r\njuicy style, but his earth has no pulsation. Courbet has forgotten the\r\nbirds in his landscape. His seas have been seen with extraordinary\r\nlargeness of feeling, and they are masterpieces of drawing; the only\r\ndrawback is that they seem uninhabitable for fish. Under the steady hand\r\nof the master the sea came to a standstill and was changed into rock. If\r\nhe has to paint human beings they stand as motionless as blocks of wood.\r\nThe expression of their faces seems galvanised into life, like their\r\nbodies. Placing absolute directness in the rendering of impressions in\r\ntheir programme, as the chief aim of their artistic endeavours, the\r\nImpressionists were the first to discover the secret of seizing with the\r\nutmost freshness the _nuances_ of expression and movement, which\r\nremained petrified in the hands of their predecessors. Only the flash of\r\nthe spokes is painted in the wheel of a carriage in motion, and never\r\nthe appearance of the wheel when it is at rest; in the same way they\r\nallow the outlines of human figures to relax and become indistinct, to\r\ncall up the impression of movement, the real vividness of the\r\nappearance. Colour has been established as the sole, unqualified medium\r\nof expression for the painter, and has so absorbed the drawing that the\r\nline receives, as it were, a pulsating life, and cannot be felt except\r\nin a pictorial way. In the painting of nude human figures the waxen\r\nlook--which in the traditional painting from the nude had a pretence of\r\nbeing natural--has vanished from the skin, and thousands of delicately\r\ndistinguished gradations give animation to the flesh. Moreover, a finer\r\nand deeper observation of temperament was made possible by lighter and\r\nmore sensitive technique. In the works of the earlier _genre_ painters\r\npeople never are what they are supposed to represent. The hired model,\r\npicked from the lower strata of life, and used by the painter in\r\nbringing his picture slowly to completion, was obvious even in the most\r\nelegant toilette; but now real human beings are represented, men and\r\nwomen whose carriage, gestures, and countenances tell at once what they\r\nare. Even in portrait painting people whom the painter has surprised\r\nbefore they have had time to put themselves in order, at the moment when\r\nthey are still entirely natural, have taken the place of lay-figures\r\nfixed in position. The effort to seize the most unconstrained air and\r\nthe most natural position, and to arrest the most transitory shade of\r\nexpression, produces, in this field of art also, a directness and\r\nvivacity divided by a great gulf from the pose and the grand airs of the\r\nearlier drawing-room picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RENOIR.   A PRIVATE BOX.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nFrom his very first appearance there gathered round Manet a number of\r\nyoung men who met twice a week at a caf\xc3\xa9 in Batignolles, formerly a\r\nsuburb at the entrance of the Avenue de Clichy. After this\r\ntrysting-place the society called itself _L\'\xc3\x89cole des Batignolles_.\r\nBurty, Antonin Proust, Henner, and Stevens put in an occasional\r\nappearance, but Legros, Whistler, Fantin-Latour, Duranty, and Zola were\r\nconstant visitors. Degas, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Monet, Gauguin, and\r\nZandomeneghi were the leading spirits of the impressionistic staff, and,\r\nbeing excluded from the official Salon, they generally set up their tent\r\nat Nadar\'s, Reichshofen\'s, or some other dealer\'s. These are the names\r\nof the men who, following Manet, were the earliest to make the new\r\nproblem the object of their studies.\r\n\r\n_Degas_, the subtle colourist and miraculous draughtsman, who celebrates\r\ndancers, gauze skirts, and the _foyers_ of the Opera, is the boldest and\r\nthe most original of those who banded together from the very outset of\r\nthe movement--the worst enemy of everything pretty and banal, the\r\ngreatest dandy of modern France, the man whose works are caviare to the\r\ngeneral and so refreshing to the _gourmet_, the painter who can find a\r\njoy in the sublime beauty of ugliness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RENOIR.   THE TERRACE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nDegas was older than Manet. He had run through all phases of French art\r\nsince Ingres. His first pictures, "Spartan Youths" and "Semiramis\r\nbuilding the Walls of Babylon," might indeed have been painted by\r\nIngres, to whom he looks up even now as to the first star in the\r\nfirmament of French art. Then for a time he was influenced by the\r\nsuggestive and tender intimacy in feeling and the soft, quiet harmony of\r\nChardin. He had also an enthusiasm for Delacroix: less for his\r\nexaggerated colouring than for the lofty mark of style in the gestures\r\nand movements painted by this great Romanticist, which Degas endeavoured\r\nto transfer to the pantomime of the ballet. From Manet he learnt\r\nsoftness and fluency of modelling. And finally the Japanese communicated\r\nto him the principle of their dispersed composition, the choice of\r\nstandpoint, allowing the artist to look up from beneath or down from\r\nabove, the taste for fantastic decoration, the suggestive method of\r\nemphasising this and suppressing that, the surprise of detail introduced\r\nhere and there in a perfectly arbitrary fashion. From the original and\r\nbizarre union of all these elements he formed his exquisite,\r\nmarvellously expressive, and entirely personal style, which is hard to\r\ndescribe with the pen, and would be defectively indicated by reference\r\nto Besnard, who is allied to him in the treatment of light. It is only\r\nin literature that Degas has a parallel. If a comparison between them be\r\nat all possible, it might be said that his style in many ways recalls\r\nthat of the brothers de Goncourt. As these have enriched their language\r\nwith a new vocabulary for the expression of new emotions, Degas has made\r\nfor himself a new technique. Utterly despising everything pretty and\r\nanecdotic, he has the secret of gaining the effect intended by\r\nrefinements of drawing and tone-values, just as the de Goncourts by the\r\nassociation of words; he has borrowed phrases from all the lexicons of\r\npainting; he has mixed oils, pastel, and water-colour together, and,\r\nsuch as he is to-day, he must, like the de Goncourts, be reckoned\r\namongst the most delicate and refined artists of the century.\r\n\r\nHis range of subjects finds its limit in one point: he has the greatest\r\ncontempt for banality, for the repetition of others and of himself.\r\nEvery subject has to give opportunity for the introduction of special\r\nmodels, not hitherto employed, of pictorial experiments and novel\r\nproblems of light. He made his starting-point, the grace and charming\r\nmovements of women. Trim Parisian laundresses in their spotless aprons,\r\nlittle shop-girls in their _boutiques_, the spare grace of racehorses\r\nwith their elastic jockeys, marvellous portraits, like that of Duranty,\r\nwomen getting out of the bath, the movements of the workwoman, and the\r\ntoilette and _n\xc3\xa9glig\xc3\xa9_ of the woman of the world, boudoir scenes, scenes\r\nin court, and scenes in boxes at the theatre--he has painted them all.\r\nAnd with what truth and life! How admirably his figures stand! how\r\ncompletely they are what they give themselves out to be! The Circus and\r\nthe Opera soon became his favourite field of study. In his ballet-girls\r\nhe found fresher artistic material than in the goddesses and nymphs of\r\nthe antique.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the highest conceivable demands were here made on the\r\ncapacities of the painter and the draughtsman, and on his powers of\r\ncharacterisation. Of all modern artists Degas is the man who creates the\r\ngreatest illusion as an interpreter of artificial light, of the glare of\r\nthe footlights before which these _d\xc3\xa9collet\xc3\xa9_ singers move in their\r\ngauze skirts. And these dancers are real dancers, vivid every one of\r\nthem, every one of them individual. The nervous force of the born\r\nballerina is sharply differentiated from the apathy of the others who\r\nmerely earn their bread by their legs. How fine are his novices with\r\ntired, faded, pretty faces, when they have to sweep a curtsey, and pose\r\nso awkwardly in their delightful shyness. How marvellously he has\r\ngrasped the fleeting charm of this moment. With what spirited\r\nnonchalance he groups his girls enveloped in white muslin and coloured\r\nsashes. Like the Japanese, he claims the right of rendering only what\r\ninterests him and appears to make a striking effect--"the vivid points,"\r\nin Hokusai\'s phrase--and does not hold himself bound to add a lifeless\r\npiece of canvas for the sake of "rounded composition." In pictures,\r\nwhere it is his purpose to show the varied forms of the legs and feet of\r\nhis dancers, he only paints the upper part of the orchestra and the\r\nlower part of the stage--that is to say, heads, hands, and instruments\r\nbelow, and dancing legs above. He is equally uncompromising in his\r\nstreet and racing scenes, so that often it is merely the hindquarters of\r\nthe horses and the back of the jockey that are visible. His pictures,\r\nhowever, owe not a little of their life and piquancy to this brilliant\r\nmethod of cutting through the middle, and to these triumphant evasions\r\nof all the vulgar rules of composition. But, for the matter of that,\r\nsurely D\xc3\xbcrer knew what he was about when, in his pictures of apocalyptic\r\nriders, instead of completing the composition, he left it fragmentary,\r\nto create an impression of the wild gallop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. PISSARRO.   SITTING UP.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. PISSARRO.   ROUEN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nA special group amongst the artist\'s ballet pictures is that in which he\r\nrepresents the training of novices, the severe course through which the\r\ngrub must pass before taking wing as a butterfly. Here is displayed a\r\nstrange fantastic anatomy, only comparable to the acrobatic distortions\r\nto which the Japanese are so much addicted in their art. But it is\r\nprecisely these pictures which were of determining importance for the\r\ndevelopment of Degas. In the quest of unstable lines and expressions,\r\ninstead of feeling reality in all its charming grace, he came to behold\r\nit only in its degeneration. He was impelled to render the large outline\r\nof the modern woman--the female figure which has grown to be a product\r\nof art beneath the array of toilette--even in the most ungraceful\r\nmoments. He painted the woman who does not suspect that she is being\r\nobserved; he painted her seen, as it were, through the key-hole or the\r\nslit of a curtain, and making, to some extent, the most atrociously ugly\r\nmovements. He was the merciless observer of creatures whom society turns\r\ninto machines for its pleasure--dancing, racing, and erotic machines. He\r\nhas depicted cruelly the sort of woman Zola has drawn in Nana--the woman\r\nwho has no expression, no play in her eyes, the woman who is merely\r\nanimal, motionless as a Hindu idol. His pictures of this class are a\r\nnatural history of prostitution of terrible veracity, a great poem on\r\nthe flesh, like the works of Titian and Rubens, except that in the\r\nlatter blooming beauty is the substance of the brilliant strophes,\r\nwhile in Degas it is wrinkled skin, decaying youth, and the artificial\r\nbrightness of enamelled faces. "_A vous autres il faut la vie naturelle,\r\n\xc3\xa0 moi la vie factice._"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art fran\xc3\xa7aise._\r\n\r\n  C. PISSARRO.   SYDENHAM CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nThis sense of having lived too much expressed itself also in the haughty\r\ncontempt with which he withdrew himself from exhibitions, the public,\r\nand criticism. Any one who is not a constant visitor at Durand-Ruel\'s\r\nhas little opportunity of seeing the pictures of Degas. The conception\r\nof fame is something which he does not seem to possess. Being a man of\r\ncool self-reliance, he paints to please himself, without caring how his\r\npictures may suit the notions of the world or the usages of the schools.\r\nFor years he has kept aloof from the Salon, and some people say that he\r\nhas never exhibited at all. And he keeps at as great a distance from\r\nParisian society. In earlier days, when Manet, Pissarro, and Duranty met\r\nat the Caf\xc3\xa9 Nouvelle Ath\xc3\xa8nes, he sometimes appeared after ten o\'clock--a\r\nlittle man with round shoulders and a shuffling walk, who only took part\r\nin the conversation by now and then breaking in with brief, sarcastic\r\nobservations. After Manet\'s death he made the Caf\xc3\xa9 de la Rochefoucauld\r\nhis place of resort. And young painters went on his account also to the\r\nCaf\xc3\xa9 de la Rochefoucauld and pointed him out to each other, saying,\r\n"That is Degas." When artists assemble together the conversation usually\r\nturns upon him, and he is accorded the highest honours by the younger\r\ngeneration. He is revered as the haughty _Independant_ who stands\r\nunapproachably above the _profanum vulgus_, the great unknown who never\r\npassed through the ordeal of a hanging committee, but whose spirit\r\nhovers invisibly over every exhibition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SISLEY.   OUTSKIRTS OF A WOOD.]\r\n\r\nA refined _charmeur_, _Auguste Renoir_, has made important discoveries,\r\nin portrait painting especially. He is peculiarly the painter of women,\r\nwhose elegance, delicate skin, and velvet flesh he interprets with\r\nextraordinary deftness. L\xc3\xa9on Bonnat\'s portraits were great pieces of\r\nstill-life. The persons sit as if they were nailed to their seats. Their\r\nflesh looks like zinc and their clothes like steel. In Carolus Duran\'s\r\nhands portrait painting degenerated into a painting of draperies. Most\r\nof his portraits merely betray the amount which the toilettes have cost;\r\nthey are inspired by their rich array of silk and heavy curtains; often\r\nthey are crude symphonies in velvet and satin. The rustle of robes, the\r\ndazzling--or loud--fulness of colour in glistening materials, gave him\r\ngreater pleasure than the lustre of flesh-tints and any glance of\r\ninquiry into the moral temperament of his models. Renoir endeavours to\r\narrest the scarcely perceptible and transitory movements of the features\r\nand the figure. Placing his persons boldly in the real light of day\r\nwhich streams around, he paints atmospheric influences in all their\r\nresults, like a landscapist. Light is the sole and absolute thing. The\r\nfallen trunk of a tree upon which the broken sunlight plays in yellow\r\nand light green reflections, and the body or head of a girl, are subject\r\nto the same laws. Stippled with yellowish-green spots of light, the\r\nlatter loses its contours and becomes a part of nature. With this study\r\nof the effects of light and reflection there is united an astonishing\r\nsureness in the analysis of sudden phases of expression. The way in\r\nwhich laughter begins and ends, the moment between laughter and weeping,\r\nthe passing flash of an eye, a fleeting motion of the lips, all that\r\ncomes like lightning and vanishes as swiftly, shades of expression which\r\nhad hitherto seemed indefinable, are seized by Renoir in all their\r\nsuddenness. In the portraits of Bonnat and Duran there are people who\r\nhave "sat," but here are people from whom the painter has had the power\r\nof stealing and holding fast the secret of their being at a moment when\r\nthey were not "sitting." Here are dreamy blond girls gazing out of their\r\ngreat blue eyes, ethereal fragrant flowers, like lilies leaning against\r\na rose-bush through which the rays of the setting sun are shining. Here\r\nare coquettish young girls, now laughing, now pouting, now blithe and\r\ngay, now angry once more, and now betwixt both moods in a charming\r\npassion. And there are women of the world of consummate elegance,\r\nslender and slight-built figures, with small hands and feet, an even\r\npallor, almond-shaped eyes catching every light, moist shining lips of a\r\ntender grace, bearing witness to a love of pleasure refined by artifice.\r\nAnd children especially there are, children of the sensitive and\r\nflexuous type: some as yet unconscious, dreamy, and free from thought;\r\nothers already animated, correct in pose, graceful, and wise. The three\r\ngirls, in his "Portrait of Mesdemoiselles M----," grouped around the\r\npiano, the eldest playing, the second accompanying upon the violin, and\r\nthe youngest quietly attentive, with both hands resting upon the piano,\r\nare exquisite, painted with an entirely na\xc3\xafve and novel truth. All the\r\nposes are natural, all the colours bright and subtle--the furniture, the\r\nyellow bunches of flowers, the fresh spring dresses, the silk stockings.\r\nBut such tender poems of childhood and blossoming girlhood form merely a\r\npart of Renoir\'s work. In his "Dinner at Chaton" a company of ladies and\r\ngentlemen are seated at table, laughing, talking, and listening; the\r\nchampagne sparkles in the glasses, and the cheerful, easy mood which\r\ncomes with dessert is in the ascendant. In his "Moulin de la Galette" he\r\npainted the excitement of the dance--whirling pairs, animated faces,\r\nlanguid poses, and everything enveloped in sunlight and dust. Renoir\'s\r\npeculiar field is the study of the various delicate emotions which\r\ncolour the human countenance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _By permission of M. Durand-Ruel._\r\n\r\n  MONET.   A STUDY.]\r\n\r\nThe merit of _Camille Pissarro_ is to have once more set the painting of\r\npeasants, weakened by Breton, upon the virile lines of Millet, and to\r\nhave supplemented them in those places where Millet was technically\r\ninadequate. When the Impressionist movement began Camille Pissarro had\r\nalready a past: he was the recognised landscape painter of the Norman\r\nplains; the straightforward observer of peasants, the plain and simple\r\npainter of the vegetable gardens stretching round peasant dwellings.\r\nSince Millet, no artist had placed himself in closer relationship to the\r\nlife of the earth and of cultivated nature. Though a delicate analyst,\r\nPissarro had not the epic feeling nor the religious mysticism of Millet;\r\nbut like Millet he was a rustic in spirit, like him a Norman, from the\r\nland of vineyards, of large farmyards, green meadows, soft avenues of\r\npoplars, and wide horizons reddened by the sun. He was healthy, tender,\r\nand intimate in feeling, rejoiced in the richness of the land and the\r\nvoluptuous undulation of fields, and he could give a striking impression\r\nof a region in its work-a-day character. Celebrated in the press as the\r\nlegitimate descendant of Millet, he might have contented himself with\r\nhis regular successes. He had, indeed, arrived at an age when men\r\nusually leave off making experiments, and reap what they have sown in\r\ntheir youth, at an age when many conquerors occupy themselves with the\r\nmechanical reproduction of their own works. Nevertheless the\r\nImpressionistic movement became for Pissarro the starting-point of a new\r\nway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLAUDE MONET.   _The Century._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONET\'S HOME AT GIVERNY.   _The Century._]\r\n\r\nHe aimed at fresher, intenser, and more transparent light, at a more\r\ncogent observation of phenomena, at a more exact analysis of the\r\nencompassing atmosphere. He celebrated the eternal, immutable light in\r\nwhich the world is bathed. He loved it specially during clear\r\nafternoons, when it plays over bright green meadows fringed by soft\r\ntrees, or at the foot of low hills. He has sought it on the slopes\r\nacross which it ripples deliciously, on the plains from which it rises\r\nlike a light veil of gauze. He studied the play of light upon the\r\nbronzed skin of labourers, on the coats of animals, on the foliage and\r\nfruit of trees. He characterised the seasons, the hour of day, the\r\nmoment, with the conscientiousness of a peasant intent upon noting the\r\ndirection of the wind and the position of the sun. The cold, chilly\r\nhumour of autumn afternoons, the vivid clarity of sparkling wintry\r\nskies, the bloom and lightness of spring mornings, the oppressive\r\nbrooding of summer, the luxuriance or the aridity of the earth, the\r\nyoung vigour of foliage or the fading of nature robbed of her\r\nadornment,--all these Pissarro has painted with largeness, plainness,\r\nand simplicity. He strays over the fields, watching the shepherd driving\r\nout his flock, the wains rumbling along the uneven roads, the quiet,\r\nrhythmical movement of the gleaners, the graceful gait of the women who\r\nhave been reaping and now return home in the evening with a rake across\r\ntheir shoulders; he stations himself at the entrance of villages where\r\nthe apple-pickers are at work, and the women minding geese stand by\r\ntheir drove; he notes the whole life of peasants, and gives truer and\r\nmore direct intelligence of it than Millet did in his broad, synthetic\r\nmanner. Where there is a classic quietude and an oily heaviness in\r\nMillet, there is in Pissarro palpitating life, transparence, and\r\nfreshness. He sees the country in bright, laughing tones; and the pure\r\nwhite of the kerchiefs, the pale rose-colour or tender blue bodices of\r\nhis peasant women, lend his pictures a blithe delicacy of colour. His\r\ngirls are like fresh flowers of the field which the sun of June brings\r\nforth upon the meadows. There is something intense and yet soft, strong\r\nand delicate, true and rhythmical in Pissarro\'s tender poems of country\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONET.   MORNING ON THE SEINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONET.   A WALK IN GREY WEATHER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nSo long as any advance beyond Rousseau and Corot seemed impossible,\r\npictures of talent but only moderate importance had increased in number\r\nin the province of landscape. The landscape painters who immediately\r\nfollowed the great pioneers loved nature on account of her comparative\r\ncoolness in summer; upon sites where the classic artists of\r\nFontainebleau dreamed and painted they built comfortable villas and\r\nsettled down with the sentiments of a householder. The country was\r\nparcelled out, and each one undertook his part, and painted it\r\nconscientiously without arousing any novel sensations. Impressionism\r\ngave landscape painting, which showed signs of being split into\r\nspecialties, once more a firm basis, a charming field of study. To\r\ncommunicate impressions without any of the studio combinations, just as\r\nthey strike us suddenly, to preserve the vividness and cogency of the\r\nfirst imprint of nature upon the mind, was the great problem which\r\nImpressionism placed before the landscape painters. The artists of\r\nFontainebleau painted neither the rawness and rigidity of winter nor the\r\nsultry atmosphere and scorching heat of summer; they painted artistic\r\nand dignified and exquisite works. The Impressionists did not approach\r\ntheir themes as poets, but as naturalists. In their hands landscape,\r\nwhich in Corot, Millet, Diaz, Rousseau, Daubigny, and Jongkind is an\r\noccasional poem, becomes a likeness of a region under special influences\r\nof light. With more delicate nerves, and a sensibility almost greater,\r\nthey allowed nature to work upon them, and perceived in the symphonies\r\nof every hour strains never heard before, transparent shadows, the\r\nvibration of atoms of light. decomposing the lines of contour, that\r\ntremor of the atmosphere which is the breath of landscape. Here also\r\nEngland was not without influence. As Corot and Rousseau received an\r\nimpulse from Constable and Bonington in 1830, Monet and Sisley returned\r\nfrom London with their eyes dazzled by the light of the great Turner.\r\nLaid hold upon, like Turner, by the miracles of the universe, by the\r\ngolden haze which trembles in a sunbeam, they succeeded in painting\r\nlight in spite of the defectiveness of our chemical mediums.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONET.   THE CHURCH AT VARANG\xc3\x89VILLE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n_Alfred Sisley_ might be compared with Daubigny. He settled in the\r\nneighbourhood of Moret, upon the banks of the Loing, and is the most\r\nsoft and tender amongst the Impressionists. Like Daubigny, he loves the\r\ngerminating energy, the blossoming, and the growth of young and luminous\r\nspring; the moist banks of quiet streamlets, budding beeches, and the\r\nrye-fields growing green, the variegated flowering of the meadows, clear\r\nskies, ladies walking in bright spring dresses, and the play of light\r\nupon the vernal foliage. He has painted tender mornings breathed upon\r\nwith rosy bloom, reeds with a bluish gleam, and moist duck-weed, grey\r\nclouds mirrored in lonely pools, alleys of poplar, peasants\' houses, and\r\nhills and banks, melting softly in the warm atmosphere. His pictures,\r\nlike those of the master of Oise, leave the impression of youth and\r\nfreshness, of quiet happiness, or of smiling melancholy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONET.   RIVER SCENE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONET.   THE ROCKS AT BELLE-ISLE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONET.   HAY-RICKS.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nOn many of his pictures, saturated as they are with light, _Claude\r\nMonet_ could inscribe the name of Turner without inciting unbelief. In\r\nexceedingly unequal works, which are nevertheless full of audacity and\r\ngenius, he has grasped what would seem to be intangible. Except Turner\r\nthere is no one who has carried so far the study of the effects of\r\nlight, of the gradations and reflections of sunbeams, of momentary\r\nphases of illumination, no one who has embodied more subtle and forcible\r\nimpressions. For Monet man has no existence, but only the earth and the\r\nlight. He delights in the rugged rocks of Belle-Isle, and the wild banks\r\nof the Creuse, when the oppressive sun of summer is brooding over them.\r\nHe paints phenomena as transitory as the shades of expression in Renoir.\r\nThe world appears in a glory of light, such as it only has in fleeting\r\nmoments, and such as would be blinding were it always to be seen.\r\nNature, in his version, is an inhospitable dwelling where it is\r\nimpossible to dream and live. One hopes sometimes to hear a word of\r\nintimate association from Monet--but in vain; Claude Monet is only an\r\neye. Carouses of sunshine and orgies in the open air are the exclusive\r\nmaterials of his pictures. Thus he has little to say for those who seek\r\nthe soul of a human being in every landscape. Like Degas, he is _par\r\nexcellence_ the master in technique whose highest endeavour is to\r\nenrich the art of painting with novel sensations and unedited effects,\r\neven if it has to be done by violence. There are sea-pieces filled with\r\nthe spirit of evening, when the sea, red as a mirror of copper, merges\r\ninto the glory of the sky, in a great radiant ocean of infinity; moods\r\nof evening storm, when gloomy clouds over the restless tree-tops race\r\nacross the smoky red sky, losing tiny shreds in their flight, little\r\nthin strips of loosened cloud, saturated through and through with a\r\nwine-red glow by the splendour of the sun. Or there are spring meadows\r\nfragrant with bloom, and hills parched by the sun; rushing trains with\r\ntheir white smoke gleaming in the light; yellow sails scudding over\r\nglittering waters; waves shining blue, red, and golden; and burning\r\nships, with shooting tongues of flame leaping upon the masts; and,\r\nbehind, a jagged rim of the evening glow. Claude Monet has followed\r\nlight everywhere--in Holland, Normandy, the South of France,\r\nBelle-Isle-en-Mer, the villages of the Seine, London, Algiers, Brittany.\r\nHe became an enthusiast for nature as she is in Norway and Sweden, for\r\nFrench cathedrals rising into the sky, tall and fair, like the peaks of\r\ngreat promontories. He interpreted the surge of towns, the movement of\r\nthe sea, the majestic solitude of the sky. But he knows too that the\r\nartist could pass his life in the same corner of the earth and work for\r\nyears upon the same objects without the drama of nature played before\r\nhim ever becoming exhausted. For the light which streams between things\r\nis for ever different. So he stood one evening two paces in front of his\r\nlittle house, in the garden, amid a flaming sea of flowers scarlet like\r\npoppies. White summer clouds shifted in the sky, and the beams of the\r\nsetting sun fell upon two stacks, standing solitary in a solitary field.\r\nClaude Monet began to paint, and came again the next day, and the day\r\nafter that, and every day throughout the autumn, and winter, and spring.\r\nIn a series of fifteen pictures, "The Hay-ricks," he painted--as Hokusai\r\ndid in his hundred views of the Fuji mountain--the endless variations\r\nproduced by season, day, and hour upon the eternal countenance of\r\nnature. The lonely field is like a glass, catching the effects of\r\natmosphere, the breeze, and the most fleeting light. The stacks gleam\r\nsoftly in the brightness of the beautiful afternoons, stand out sharp\r\nand clear against the cold sky of the forenoon, loom like phantoms in\r\nthe mist of a November evening, or sparkle like glittering jewels\r\nbeneath the caress of the rising sun. They shine like glowing ovens,\r\nabsorbed by the light of the autumnal sunset; they are surrounded as by\r\na rosy halo, when the early sun pierces like a wedge through the dense\r\nmorning mist. They rise distinctly, covered with sparkling, rose-tinged\r\nsnow, into the cloudless heaven, and cast their pure, blue shadows upon\r\nthe silent, white, wintry landscape, or stand out in ghostly outlines\r\nagainst the night firmament, mantled with silver by the moonlight.\r\nWithout moving his easel, Monet has interpreted the silence of winter,\r\nand autumn with her sad and splendid feasts of colour--dusk and rain,\r\nsnow and frost and sun. He heard the voices of evening and the\r\njubilation of morning; he painted the eternal undulation of light upon\r\nthe same objects, the altered impression which the same particle of\r\nnature yields according to the changing light of the hour. He chanted\r\nthe poetry of the universe in a single fragment of nature, and would be\r\na pantheistic artist of world-wide compass had he merely painted these\r\nstacks of hay for the rest of his natural existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  MONET.   A VIEW OF ROUEN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nAnd here ends the battle for the liberation of modern art. _Libertas\r\nartibus restituta._ The painters of the nineteenth century are no longer\r\nimitators, but have become makers of a new thing, "enlargers of the\r\nempire." The prophetic words written in the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury by the Hamburger, Philipp Otto Runge, "light, colour, and moving\r\nlife," were to form the great problem, the great conquest of modern art;\r\nthey were fulfilled after two generations. Through the Impressionists\r\nart was enriched by an opulence of new beauties. A new and independent\r\nstyle had been discovered for the representation of new things, and a\r\nnew province--a province peculiar to herself--was won for painting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW IDEALISM IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flood of Impressionism was at the same time crossed by another\r\ncurrent. Impressionism was a phase of progressive art of world-wide\r\ninfluence. It proclaimed that nature and life were the inexhaustible\r\nmine of beauty. Then after Naturalism had taught artists to work upon\r\nthe impressions of external reality in an independent manner, a\r\ntransition was made by some who embodied the impressions of their inward\r\nspirit in a free creative fashion, unborrowed from the old masters.\r\n\r\nWe feel the need of living not merely in the world around us, but in an\r\ninner world that we build up ourselves, a world far more strange and\r\nfair, far more luminous than that in which our feet stumble so\r\nhelplessly. We must needs mount upon the pinions of fancy into the wide\r\nland of vision, build castles in the clouds, watch their rise and their\r\nfall, and follow into misty distance the freaks of their changing\r\narchitecture. The more grey and colourless the present may be, the more\r\nalluringly does the fairy splendour of vanished worlds of beauty flit\r\nbefore us. It is the very banality of everyday life that renders us more\r\nsensitive to the delicate charm of old myths, and we receive them in a\r\nmore childlike, impressionable way than any earlier age, for we look\r\nupon them with fresh eyes that have been rendered keen by yearning.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it is evident that Impressionism could not remain the mode\r\nof expression for the whole world of the present day. The longing for\r\nold-world romance would brook no refusal. It was demanded from art not\r\nthat she should mirror nature, nature could be seen without her aid, but\r\nthat she should carry us away on dream-wings to a distant world more\r\nbeautiful than our own; not that she should be merely modern, but that\r\nshe should afford us even to-day some reflection of that beauty which\r\nsheds forth its lustre from the works of the old masters.\r\n\r\nThis yearning after far-off worlds of beauty was combined with a demand\r\nfor new delights of colour. The Impressionists had centred every effort\r\nin compassing the most difficult elements of the world of\r\nphenomena--light, air, and colour--ending in extreme imitation of\r\nreality. Then came a desire for colours, more radiant, more vivid than\r\never was seen on this poor world of ours; and since hardly any of the\r\nyounger generation fulfilled the desire of the modern longing, the\r\nstandard of a bygone age was raised aloft, and there set in the\r\nanti-naturalistic, anti-modern current that still survived from the age\r\nof romance in the work-a-day world of the present.\r\n\r\nHow was it possible that England should have taken the lead upon this\r\noccasion also? Can an Englishman, a matter-of-fact being who finds his\r\nhappiness in comfort and a practical sphere of action, be at the same\r\ntime a Romanticist? Is not London the most modern town in Europe? Yet,\r\nwithout a question, this is the very reason why the New Romanticism\r\nfound its earliest expression there, although it was the place where\r\nNaturalism had reigned longest and with the greatest strictness. There\r\nwas a reaction against the prose of everyday life, just as, in the\r\nearlier part of the century, English landscape painting had been a\r\nreaction against town life. To escape the whistle of locomotives and the\r\nrestless bustle of the struggle for existence, men take refuge in a\r\nfar-off world, a world where everything is fair and graceful, and all\r\nemotions tender and noble, a world where no rudeness, no discord, and\r\nnothing fierce or brutal disturbs the harmony of ideal perfection. These\r\nartists become revellers in a land of fantasy, and flee from reality to\r\nan inner life which they have created for themselves, wander from\r\nLondon\'s railways and fogs to the sunny Italy of Botticelli, take their\r\nrest in the land of poetry, and come back with packing-cases full of\r\nlovely pictures and hearts full of happy emotions.\r\n\r\nMoreover, they find in the primitive artists that simplicity which is\r\nmost refreshing of all to overstrained spirits. Having produced Byron,\r\nShelley, and Turner, the English were artistic _gourmets_, sated with\r\nall enjoyments in the realms of the intellect, and they now meditated\r\nworks through which yet a new thrill of beauty might pass through the\r\nimagination. In the primitive masters they discovered all the qualities\r\nwhich had vanished from art since the sixteenth century--inofficious\r\npurity, innocent and touching Naturalism, antiquated austerity, and an\r\nenchanting depth of feeling. Jaded with other experiences, they admired\r\nin those na\xc3\xafve spirits the capacity for ecstatic rapture and vision--in\r\nother words, for the highest gratification. If one could but have in\r\nthis nineteenth century such feelings as were known to Dante, the gloomy\r\nFlorentine; Botticelli, the great Jeremiah of the Renaissance; or the\r\ntender mystic Fra Angelico! Surfeited with modernity, and endowed with\r\nnerves of acute refinement, artists went back in their fancy to this\r\nluxuriously blissful condition, and finally came to the point at which\r\nmodernity was transformed once more into childish babble and the\r\nunbelieving materialism of the present age into a mystical and romantic\r\nunion with the old currents of emotion.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti English pre-Raphaelitism\r\nnow entered upon a new and entirely different phase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.   _Mag. of Art._]\r\n\r\nAlthough Rossetti was the soul of the earlier movement, he was a man\r\nwhose temperament was even then essentially different from that of his\r\ncomrades Millais and Hunt, who founded the Brotherhood with him in 1848.\r\nEven the two works which he exhibited with them in 1849 and 1850 make\r\none feel the great gulf which lay between him and them. In the former\r\nyear, when Hunt was represented by his "Rienzi," and Millais by his\r\n"Lorenzo and Isabella," Rossetti produced his "Girlhood of Mary Virgin."\r\nIn the following, when Hunt painted "The Converted British Family\r\nsheltering a Christian Missionary" and Millais "The Child Jesus in the\r\nWorkshop of Joseph the Carpenter," Rossetti came forward with his "Ecce\r\nAncilla Domini." "The Girlhood of Mary Virgin" was a little picture of\r\naustere simplicity and ascetic character; it was intentionally angular\r\nin drawing, and possessed a certain archaic bloom. The Virgin, clad in\r\ngrey garments, sits at a curiously shaped frame embroidering a lily with\r\ngold threads upon a red ground. The flower she is copying stands before\r\nher in a vase, and a little angel, with roseate wings, is watering it\r\nwith an air of abashed reverence. St. Anne is busy by the side of the\r\nVirgin--both being, respectively, portraits of the artist\'s mother and\r\nsister--and in the background St. Joachim is binding a vine to a\r\ntrellis. And several Latin books are lying upon the floor. The second\r\nwork, "Ecce Ancilla Domini," is the familiar picture which is now in the\r\nNational Gallery--a harmony of white upon white of indescribable\r\ngraciousness and delicacy. Mary, a bashful, meditative, and childlike\r\nmaiden, in a white garment, is shown in a half-kneeling attitude upon a\r\nwhite bed. The walls of the chamber are white, and in front of her there\r\nstands a frame at which she has been working; and a piece of embroidery,\r\nwith a lily which she has begun, hangs over it. Before her stands the\r\nangel with flame rising from his feet, in solemn, peaceful gravity, as\r\nhe extends towards her the stalk of the lily which he holds. A dove\r\nflies gently in through the window. Now, in spite of their romantic\r\nsubjects the work of Hunt and Millais is lucid and temperate, while\r\nRossetti is dreamily mystical. The two former were straightforward,\r\ntrue, and natural, whereas the simplicity of the latter was subtilised\r\nand consciously affected. It was due to the vibrating delicacy of his\r\ndistempered, seething imagination that he was able to give himself a\r\ndeceptive appearance of being a primitive artist. The creative power of\r\nthe two former is an earnest power of the understanding, whereas in the\r\nlatter there is a vague dreaminess, a tendency to luxuriate in his own\r\nmoods, an efflorescence of tones and colours. In the one case there is\r\nan angular but single-minded study of nature; in the other there is the\r\ndemureness and embarrassment of the Quattrocento, a demureness breaking\r\ninto blossom, and an embarrassment full of charm--a romanticism which\r\ncherished the yearning for repose in the childlike and innocent Middle\r\nAges, and clothed it with all the attractions of mysticism. Holman Hunt,\r\nMadox Brown, and Millais were realists in their drawing, men who wanted\r\nto represent objects with all possible accuracy, to be faithful in\r\nrendering the finest fibre of a petal and every thread in a fabric.\r\nRossetti\'s picture was a symphonic ode in pigments, and he himself was\r\none of the earliest of the modern lyricists of colour. This distinction\r\nbecame wider and wider with the course of time, and as early as 1858 he\r\nfound himself deserted by his earlier comrades. Madox Brown, Holman\r\nHunt, and especially Millais, in their further development, tended more\r\nand more to become Naturalists, and were finally led to completely\r\nrealistic subjects from the immediate present by the inviolable fidelity\r\nwith which they studied nature. On the other hand, Rossetti became the\r\ncentre of a new circle of artists, who directed the current of what was\r\noriginally Naturalism more and more into mysticism and refined archaism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  ROSSETTI.   BEATA BEATRIX.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nIn 1856 _The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine_ was founded as a monthly\r\nperiodical. There were several contributions by Rossetti, and in this\r\nway he became so well known in Oxford that the Union accepted an offer\r\nfrom him to execute a series of wall-paintings. Accordingly he painted\r\nseveral pictures from the Arthurian legends, making the sketches for\r\nthem himself, and employing for their elaboration a number of young men,\r\nsome of them amateur artists and students at the University. In this way\r\nhe came into connection with Arthur Hughes, William Morris, and Edward\r\nBurne-Jones. These artists, afterwards joined by Spencer Stanhope and\r\nWalter Crane, both of them younger men, became--with George Frederick\r\nWatts at their flank--the leading members of the new brotherhood, the\r\nrepresentatives of that New pre-Raphaelitism in which interest is still\r\ncentred in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pageant._\r\n\r\n  ROSSETTI.   MONNA ROSA.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. W. M. Rossetti._)]\r\n\r\nTheir art is a kind of Italian Renaissance upon English soil. The\r\nromantic chord which vibrates in old English poetry is united to the\r\ngrace and purity of Italian taste, the classical lucidity of the Pagan\r\nmythology with Catholic mysticism, and the most modern riot of emotion\r\nwith the demure vesture of the primitive Florentines. Through this\r\nmixture of heterogeneous elements English New Idealism is probably the\r\nmost remarkable form of art upon which the sun has ever shone: borrowed\r\nand yet in the highest degree personal, it is an art combining an almost\r\nchildlike simplicity of feeling with a morbid _hautgo\xc3\xbbt_, the most\r\nattentive and intelligent study of the old masters with free, creative,\r\nmodern imagination, the most graceful sureness of drawing and the most\r\nsparkling individuality of colour with a helpless, stammering accent\r\nintroduced of set purpose. The old Quattrocentisti wander amongst the\r\nreal Italian flowers; but with the New pre-Raphaelites one enters a\r\nhot-house: one is met by a soft damp heat, bright exotic flowers exhale\r\nan overpowering fragrance, juicy fruits catch the eye, and slender\r\npalms, through the branches of which no rough wind may bluster, gently\r\nsway their long, broad fans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  ROSSETTI.   ECCE ANCILLA DOMINI.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. T. Agnew & Sons, the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nProfessor Lombroso would certainly find the material for ingenious\r\ndisquisition in Rossetti, who introduced this Italian phase, and himself\r\ncame of an Italian stock. And it might almost seem as if a soul from\r\nthose old times had found its reincarnation in the lonely painter who\r\nlived at Chelsea, though it was a soul who no longer bore heaven in his\r\nheart like Fra Angelico. In his whole being he seems like a phenomenon\r\nof atavism, like a citizen of that long-buried Italy who, after many\r\ntransmigrations, had strayed into the misty North, to the bank of the\r\nThames, and from thence looked in his home-sickness ever towards the\r\nSouth, enveloped in poetry and glowing in the sun.\r\n\r\nDante Gabriel Rossetti was a Catholic and an Italian. Amid his English\r\nsurroundings he kept the feelings of one of Latin race. His father, the\r\npatriot and commentator upon Dante, had originally lived in Naples, and\r\ninflamed the popular party there by his passionate writings. In\r\nconsequence of the active part which he took in political agitation he\r\nlost his post at the Bourbon Museum, escaped from Italy upon a warship,\r\ndisguised as an English officer, settled in London in 1824, and married\r\nFrancesca Polidori, the daughter of a secretary of Count Alfieri. Here\r\nhe became Professor of the Italian language at King\'s College, and\r\npublished several works on Dante, the most important of which, _Dante\'s\r\nBeatrice_, written in 1852, once more supported the theory that Beatrice\r\nwas not a real person. Dante Gabriel, the son of this Dante student\r\nGabriele Rossetti, was born in London on 12th May 1828. The whole family\r\nactively contributed to scholarship and poetry. His elder sister, Maria\r\nFrancesca, was the authoress of _A Shadow of Dante_, a work which gives\r\na most valuable explanation of the scheme of _The Divine Comedy_; his\r\nyounger sister, Christina, was one of the most eminent poetesses of\r\nEngland; and his brother, William Michael Rossetti, is well known as an\r\nart-critic and a student of Shelley. Even from early youth Dante Gabriel\r\nRossetti was familiar with the world of Dante, and brought up in the\r\nworship of Dante\'s wonderful age and an enthusiasm for his mystic and\r\ntranscendental poetry. He knew Dante by heart, and Guido Cavalcanti. The\r\nmystical poet became his guide through life, and led him to Fra\r\nAngelico, the mystic of painting. Indeed, the world of Dante and of the\r\npainters antecedent to Raphael is his spiritual home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Portfolio._\r\n\r\n  ROSSETTI.   SANCTA LILIAS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  ROSSETTI.   ASTARTE SYRIACA.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mansell & Co._\r\n\r\n  ROSSETTI.   THE DAY DREAM.]\r\n\r\nHe was barely eighteen when he became a pupil at the Royal Academy,\r\nstudying a couple of years later under Madox Brown, who was not many\r\nyears older than himself. Even then Rossetti had an almost mesmeric\r\ninfluence upon his friends. He was a pale, tall, thin young man, who\r\nalways walked with a slight stoop; reserved, dry in his manner, and\r\ncareless in dress, there was nothing captivating about him at a\r\ntransitory meeting. But his pale face was lit up by his unusually\r\nreflective, deeply clouded, contemplative eyes; and about his defiant\r\nmouth there played that contempt of the profane crowd which is natural\r\nto a superior mind, while the laurel of fame was already twined about\r\nhis youthful forehead. In 1849, when he was exhibiting his earliest\r\npicture, he had published in _The Germ_, to say nothing of his numerous\r\npoems, a mystical, visionary, sketch in prose named _Hand and Soul_,\r\nwhich was much praised by men of the highest intellect in London. Soon\r\nafterwards he published a volume entitled _Dante and his Circle_, in\r\nwhich he translated a number of old Italian poems, and rendered Dante\'s\r\n_Vita Nuova_ into strictly archaic English prose. Reserved as he was\r\ntowards strangers, he was irresistibly attractive to his friends, and\r\nhis brilliant, genial conversation won him the goodwill of every one. A\r\nman of gifted and delicate nature, sensitive to an extreme degree, a\r\nsedentary student who had yet an enthusiasm for knightly deeds, a jaded\r\nspirit capable of morbidly heightened, exotic sensibility and soft,\r\nmelting reverie, one whose overstrained nerves only vibrated if he slept\r\nin the daytime and worked at night, it seemed as though Rossetti was\r\nborn to be the father of the _d\xc3\xa9cadence_, of that state of spirit which\r\nevery one now perceives to be flooding Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROSSETTI.   STUDY FOR ASTARTE SYRIACA.]\r\n\r\nHis later career was as quiet as its opening had been brilliant. After\r\nthat graciously sentimental little picture, "Ecce Ancilla Domini,"\r\nRossetti exhibited in public only once again; this was in 1856. From\r\nthat date the public saw no more of his painting. He worked only for his\r\nfriends and the friends of his friends. He was famous only in private,\r\nand looked up to like a god within a narrow circle of admirers. One of\r\nhis acquaintances, the painter Deverell, had introduced him in 1850 to\r\nthe woman who became for him what Saskia Uylenburgh had been for\r\nRembrandt and Helene Fourment for Rubens--his type of feminine beauty.\r\nShe was a young dressmaker\'s assistant, Miss Eleanor Siddal. Her thick,\r\nheavy hair was fair, with that faint reddish tint in it which Titian\r\npainted; it grew in two tapering bands deep down into the neck, being\r\nthere somewhat fairer than it was above, and it curled thickly. Her eyes\r\nhad something indefinite in their expression; nothing, however, that was\r\ndreamy, mobile, and changeable, for they seemed rather to be\r\ninsuperable, fathomless, and unnaturally vivid. All the play of her\r\ncountenance lay in the lower part of her face, in the nostrils, mouth,\r\nand chin. The mouth, indeed, with its deep corners, sharply chiselled\r\noutlines, and lips triumphantly curved, was particularly expressive. And\r\nher tall, slender figure had a refined distinction of line. In 1860 they\r\nmarried. Some of his most beautiful works were painted during this\r\nepoch--the "Beata Beatrix," the "Sibylla Palmifera," "Monna Vanna,"\r\n"Venus Verticordia," "Lady Lilith," and "The Beloved"--pictures which he\r\npainted without a thought of exhibition or success. After a union of\r\nbarely two years this passionately loved woman died, shortly after the\r\nbirth of a still-born child. He laid a whole volume of manuscript\r\npoems--many of them inspired by her--in the coffin, and they were buried\r\nwith her. From that time he lived solitary and secluded from the world,\r\nsurrounded by medi\xc3\xa6val antiques, in his old-fashioned house at Chelsea,\r\nentirely given up to his dreams, a stranger in a world without light. He\r\nsuffered much from ill-health, and was sensitive and hypochondriacal,\r\nand, indeed, undermined his health by an immoderate use of chloral. His\r\nfriends entreated him to bring out his poems, and all England was\r\nexpectant when Rossetti at length yielded to pressure, opened the grave\r\nof his wife, and took out the manuscript. The poems appeared in the\r\nApril of 1870. The first edition was bought up in ten days, and there\r\nfollowed six others. Wherever he appeared he was honoured like a god.\r\nBut the attacks directed against the first pictures of the\r\npre-Raphaelites were repeated, although now transferred to another\r\nregion. A pseudonymous article by Robert Buchanan in the _Contemporary\r\nReview_, and published afterwards as a pamphlet, entitled _The Fleshly\r\nSchool of Poetry_, accused Rossetti of immorality and imitation of\r\nBaudelaire and the Marquis de Sade. Rossetti stepped once more into the\r\narena, and replied by a letter in the _Athen\xc3\xa6um_ headed _The Stealthy\r\nSchool of Criticism_. From that time he shut himself up completely,\r\nnever went out, and led "the hole-and-cornerest existence."\r\n\r\nIn 1881 he published a second volume of poems, chiefly composed of\r\nballads and sonnets. A year afterwards, on 10th April 1882, he died,\r\nhonoured, even in the academical circles in which he never mingled, as\r\none of the greatest men in England. The exhibition of his works which\r\nwas opened a couple of months after his death created an immense\r\nsensation. Those of his pictures which had not been already sold\r\nstraight from the easel were paid for with their weight in gold, and are\r\nnow scattered in great English country mansions and certain private\r\ngalleries in Florence. The only very rich collection in London is that\r\nof an intimate friend of the artist, the late Mr. Leyland, who had\r\ngathered together, in his splendid house in the West End, probably the\r\nmost beautiful work of which the East can boast in carpets and vases, or\r\nthe early Renaissance in intaglios, small bronzes, and ornaments. Here,\r\nsurrounded by the quaint and delicate pictures of Carlo Crivelli and\r\nBotticelli, Rossetti was in the society of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  ROSSETTI.   DANTE\'S DREAM.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Liverpool, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  ROSSETTI.   ROSA TRIPLEX.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nHis range of subject was not wide. In his earliest period he had a fancy\r\nfor painting small biblical pictures, of which "Ecce Ancilla Domini" is\r\nthe best known, and the delightfully archaic "Girlhood of Mary Virgin"\r\none of the most beautiful. But this austerely biblical tendency was not\r\nof long continuance. It soon gave way to a brilliant, imaginative\r\nRomanticism, to which he was prompted by Dante. "Giotto painting the\r\nPortrait of Dante," "The Salutation of Beatrice on Earth and in Eden"\r\n(from the _Vita Nuova_), "La Pia" (from the _Purgatorio_), the "Beata\r\nBeatrix," and "Dante\'s Dream," in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool,\r\nare the leading works which arose under the influence of the great\r\nItalian. The head of his wife, with her heavily veiled eyes, and\r\nGiotto\'s well-known picture of Dante, sufficed him for the creation of\r\nthe most tender, mystical poems, which, at the same time, show him in\r\nall the splendour of his wealth of colour. He revels in the most\r\nbrilliant hues; his pictures have the appearance of being bathed in a\r\nglow; and there is something deeply sensuous in his vivid and lustrous\r\ngreen, red, and violet tones. In the picture "Dante on the Anniversary\r\nof Beatrice\'s Death" the poet kneels at the open window which looks out\r\nupon Florence; he has been drawing, and a tablet is in his hand. The\r\nroom is quite simple, a frieze with angels\' heads being its only\r\nornament. Visitors of rank have come to see him--an elderly magnate and\r\nhis daughter--and have stood long behind him without his noticing their\r\npresence; for he has been thinking of Beatrice, and it is only when his\r\nattention is attracted to them by a friend that he turns round at last.\r\nThe "Beata Beatrix," in the National Gallery in London--a picture begun\r\nin 1863 and ended in the August of 1866--treats of the death of Beatrice\r\n"under the semblance of a trance, in which Beatrice, seated in a balcony\r\noverlooking the city, is suddenly rapt from earth to heaven." In\r\naccordance with the description in the _Vita Nuova_, Beatrice sits in\r\nthe balcony of her father\'s palace in strange ecstasy. Across the\r\nparapet of the balcony there is a view of the Arno and of that other\r\npalace where Dante passed his youth close to his adored mistress, until\r\nthe unforgotten 9th of June 1290, when death robbed him of her. A\r\npeaceful evening light is shed upon the bank of the Arno, and plays upon\r\nthe parapet with warm silvery beams. Beatrice is dressed in a garment\r\nbelonging to no definite epoch, of green and rosy red, the colours of\r\nLove and Hope. Her head rises against a little patch of yellow sky\r\nbetween the two palaces, and seems to be surrounded by it as by a halo.\r\nShe is in a trance, has the foreknowledge of her approaching death, and\r\nalready lives through the spirit in another world, whilst her body is\r\nstill upon the earth. Her hands are touched by a heavenly light. A dove\r\nof deep rose-coloured plumage alights upon her knees, bringing her a\r\nwhite poppy; whilst opposite, before the palace of Dante, the figure of\r\nLove stands, holding a flaming heart, and announcing to the poet that\r\nBeatrice has passed to a life beyond the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  ROSSETTI.   SIR GALAHAD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pageant._\r\n\r\n  ROSSETTI.   MARY MAGDALENE AT THE HOUSE OF SIMON THE PHARISEE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. W. M. Rossetti._)]\r\n\r\n"La Donna Finestra," painted in 1879, and to be counted amongst his\r\nripest creations, has connection with that passage in the _Vita Nuova_\r\nwhere Dante sinks to the ground overcome with sorrow for Beatrice\'s\r\ndeath, and is regarded with sympathy by a lady looking down from a\r\nwindow, the Lady of Pity, the human embodiment of compassion. "Dante\'s\r\nDream" is probably the work which shows the painter at his zenith. The\r\nexpression of the heads is profound and lofty, the composition severely\r\nmedi\xc3\xa6val and admirably complete; and although the painting is laboured,\r\nthe total impression is nevertheless so cogent that it is impossible to\r\nforget it. "The scene," in Rossetti\'s own description, "is a chamber of\r\ndreams, strewn with poppies, where Beatrice is seen lying on a couch, as\r\nif just fallen back in death; the winged figure of Love carries his\r\narrow pointed at the dreamer\'s heart, and with it a branch of\r\napple-blossom; as he reaches the bier, Love bends for a moment over\r\nBeatrice with the kiss which her lover has never given her; while the\r\ntwo green-clad dream-ladies hold the pall full of May-blossom suspended\r\nfor an instant before it covers her face for ever." The expression of\r\necstasy in Dante\'s face, and the still, angelical sweetness of Beatrice,\r\nare rendered with astonishing intensity. She lies upon the bier, pale as\r\na flower, wrapped in a white shroud, with her lips parted as though she\r\nwere gently breathing, and seems not dead but fallen asleep. Her fair\r\nhair floats round her in golden waves. In its vague folds the covering\r\nof the couch displays the marble outlines of the body: and a look of\r\nbliss rests upon the pure and clear-cut features of her lovely face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNE-JONES.   CHANT D\'AMOUR.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNE-JONES.   THE DAYS OF CREATION.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nThis "painting of the soul" occupied Rossetti almost exclusively in the\r\nthird and most fruitful period of his life, when he painted hardly any\r\npictures upon the larger scale, but separate feminine figures furnished\r\nwith various poetic attributes, the deeper meaning of which is\r\ninterpreted in his poems. "The Sphinx," in which he busied himself with\r\nthe great riddle of life, is the only one containing several figures.\r\nThree persons--a youth, a man of ripe years, and a grey-beard--visit the\r\nsecret dwelling of the Sphinx to inquire their destiny of this\r\nomniscient being. It is only the man who really puts the question; the\r\ngrey-beard stumbles painfully towards her cavern, while the young man,\r\nwearied with his journey, falls dying to the earth before the very\r\nobject of his quest. The Sphinx remains in impenetrable silence, with\r\nher green, inscrutable, mysterious eyes coldly and pitilessly fixed upon\r\ninfinity. "The Blessed Damozel," "Proserpina," "Fiammetta," "The\r\nDaydream," "La Bella Mano," "La Ghirlandata," "Veronica Veronese," "Dis\r\nManibus," "Astarte Syriaca" are all separate figures dedicated to the\r\nmemory of his wife. As Dante immortalised his Beatrice, Rossetti\r\nhonoured his wife, who died so early, in his poems and his pictures. He\r\npainted her as "The Blessed Damozel," with her gentle, saint-like face,\r\nher quiet mouth, her flowing golden hair and peaceful lids. He\r\nrepresents her as an angel of God standing at the gate of Heaven,\r\nlooking down upon the earth. She is thinking of her lover, and of the\r\ntime when she will see him again in heaven, and of the sacred songs that\r\nwill be sung to him. Lilies rest upon her arm, and lovers once more\r\nunited hover around.\r\n\r\nThere is no action or rhetoric of gesture in Rossetti. His tall Gothic\r\nfigures are motionless and silent, having almost the floating appearance\r\nof visionary figures which stand long before the gaze of the dreamer\r\nwithout taking bodily form. They glide along like phantoms and shadows,\r\nlike the undulations of a blossom-laden tree or a field of corn waving\r\nin the wind. They neither talk nor weep nor laugh, and are only eloquent\r\nthrough their quiet hands, the most sensuous and the most spiritual\r\nhands ever painted, or with their eyes, the most dreamy and fascinating\r\neyes which have been rendered in art since Leonardo da Vinci. In the\r\npictures which Rossetti devoted to her, Eleanor Siddal is a marvellously\r\nlofty woman, glorified in the mysticism of a rare beauty. Rossetti\r\ndrapes his idol in Venetian fashion, with rich garments which recall\r\nGiorgione in the character of their colour, and, like Botticelli, he\r\nstrews flowers of deep fragrance around her, especially roses, which he\r\npainted with wonderful perfection and hyacinths, for which he had a\r\ngreat love, and the intoxicating perfume of which affected him greatly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNE-JONES.   CIRCE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nThis taste for beautiful and deeply lustrous colours and rich\r\naccessories is, indeed, the one purely pictorial quality which this\r\npainter-poet has, if one understands by pictorial qualities the capacity\r\nfor intoxicating one\'s self with the beauty of the visible world. His\r\ndrawing is often faulty; and his bodies, enveloped in rich and heavy\r\ngarments, are, perhaps, not invariably in accordance with anatomy. What\r\nexplains Rossetti\'s fabulous success is purely the condition of spirit\r\nwhich went to the making of his works--that nervous vibration, that\r\necstasy of opium, that combination of suffering and sensuousness, and\r\nthat romanticism drunk with beauty, which pervade his paintings. When\r\nthey appeared they seemed like a revelation of a beautiful land, only\r\none could not say where it existed--a revelation, indeed, for it\r\nrevealed for the first time a world of story which was in no sense\r\nfabulous: there came a romanticism which was something real; a style\r\narose which seemed as though it were woven of tones and colours, a style\r\nrioting in an everlasting exhilaration of spirit, breaking out sometimes\r\nin a glow of flame and sometimes in delicate, tremulous longing. Even\r\nwhere he paints a Madonna she is merely a woman in his eyes, and he\r\nendows her with the glowing fire of passionate fervour, with a trace of\r\nthe joy of the earth, which no painter has ever given her before; and\r\nthrough this union of refined modern sensuousness and Catholic mysticism\r\nhe has created a new thrill of beauty. His painting was a drop of a\r\nmost precious essence, in its hues enchanting and intoxicating, the\r\nstrongest spiritual potion ever brewed in English art. The intensity of\r\nhis overstrained sensibility, and the wonderful Southern mosaic of form\r\ninto which he poured this sensibility with elaborate refinement, make\r\nhim seem own brother to Baudelaire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNE-JONES.   PYGMALION (THE SOUL ATTAINS).\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pageant._\r\n\r\n  BURNE-JONES.   PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA.]\r\n\r\nThis tendency of spirit was so novel, this plunge in the tide of\r\nmysticism so enchanting, this delicate, archaic fragrance so\r\noverwhelming, that a new stage in the culture of modern England dates\r\nfrom the appearance of Rossetti. He borrowed nothing from his\r\ncontemporaries, and all borrowed from him. There came a time when\r\nbudding girls in London attired themselves like early Italians from\r\nDante\'s _Inferno_, when Jellaby Postlethwaite, in Du Maurier\'s mocking\r\nskit, entered a restaurant at luncheon-time, and ordered a glass of\r\nwater and placed in it a lily which he had brought with him. "What else\r\ncan I bring?" asked the waiter. "Nothing," he sighed; "that is all I\r\nneed." There began that \xc3\xa6stheticism, that yearning for the lily and that\r\ncult of the sunflower, which Gilbert and Sullivan parodied in\r\n_Patience_. Swinburne, who has tasted of emotions of the most various\r\nrealms of spirit, and in his poems set them before the world as though\r\nin marvellously chiselled goblets, represents this \xc3\xa6sthetic phase of\r\nEnglish art in literature. As a painter, Edward Burne-Jones--the\r\ngreatest of that Oxford circle which gathered round Rossetti in\r\n1856--began to work at the point where Rossetti left off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNE-JONES.   THE ANNUNCIATION.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mansell Photo._\r\n\r\n  BURNE-JONES.   THE MILL.]\r\n\r\n_Sir Edward Burne-Jones_, who must now be spoken of, was born in\r\nBirmingham in August 1833, and was reading theology in Oxford when\r\nRossetti was there painting the mural pictures for the Union. Rossetti\r\nattracted him as a flame attracts the moth. As yet he had not had any\r\nartistic training, but some of his drawings which were shown to Rossetti\r\nby a mutual friend revealed so much poetic force, in spite of their\r\nembarrassed method of expression, that the painter-poet entered into\r\ncommunication with him, and allowed him to paint in the Debating Room of\r\nthe Union a subject from the Arthurian legends, "The Death of Merlin."\r\nThe picture met with approval, and Burne-Jones abandoned theology,\r\nbecame an intimate friend of Rossetti and the companion of his studies,\r\nand went with him to London. There he designed a number of church\r\nwindows for Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, and in 1864 exhibited his\r\nfirst picture, "The Merciful Knight." Later there followed the triptych\r\n"Pyramus and Thisbe" and a picture called "The Evening Star," a\r\nglimmering landscape through which a gentle spirit in a bronze-green\r\ngarment is seen to float. But none of these works excited much\r\nattention. The small picture exhibited in 1870, "Phyllis and Demopho\xc3\xb6n,"\r\nwas even thought offensive on account of the "sensuous expression" of\r\nthe nymph. So Burne-Jones withdrew it, and for many years from that time\r\nheld aloof from all the exhibitions of the Royal Academy. For seven\r\nyears his name was never seen in a catalogue. It was only on 1st May\r\n1877, at the opening of the Grosvenor Gallery--founded by Sir Coutts\r\nLindsay, likewise a painter, to afford himself and his comrades a place\r\nof exhibition independent of the Academy--that Burne-Jones once more\r\nmade his appearance before the eyes of the world. But his pictures, like\r\nthose of Rossetti, had found their way in secrecy and by their own\r\nmerit, and of a sudden he saw himself regarded as one of the most\r\neminent painters in the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  BURNE-JONES.   THE ENCHANTMENT OF MERLIN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nHis art is the flower of most potent fragrance in English \xc3\xa6stheticism,\r\nand the admiration accorded to him in England is almost greater than\r\nthat which had been previously paid to Rossetti. The Grosvenor Gallery,\r\nwhere he exhibited his pictures at this period, was for a long time a\r\nkind of temple for the \xc3\xa6sthetes. On the opening day men and women of the\r\ngreatest refinement crowded before his works. There was a cult of\r\nBurne-Jones at the Grosvenor Gallery, as there is a cult of Wagner at\r\nBayreuth. One had to work one\'s way very gradually through the crowd to\r\nsee his pictures, which always occupied the place of honour in the\r\nprincipal room of the gallery, and I remember how helplessly I stood in\r\n1884 before the first of his pictures which I saw there.\r\n\r\nIn a kind of vestibule of early Gothic architecture there was seated in\r\nthe foreground an armed man, who, in his dark, gleaming harness and his\r\nhard and bold profile, was like a Lombard warrior, say Mantegna\'s Duke\r\nof Mantua, and as he mused he held in his hand an iron crown studded\r\nwith jewels; farther in the background, upon a high marble throne, a\r\nmaiden was seated, a young girl with reddish hair and a pale worn face,\r\nlooking with steadfast eyes far out into another world, as though in a\r\nhypnotic trance. Two youths, apparently pages, sang, leaning upon a\r\nbalustrade; while all manner of costly accessories, brilliant stuffs,\r\nlustrous marble, grey granite, and mosaic pavement, shining in green and\r\nred tones, lent the whole picture an air of exquisite richness. The\r\ntitle in the catalogue was "King Cophetua and the Beggar-Maid," and any\r\none acquainted with Proven\xc3\xa7al poetry knew that King Cophetua, the hero\r\nof an old ballad, fell in love with a beggar-girl, offered her his\r\ncrown, and married her. But this was not to be gathered from the picture\r\nitself, where all palpable illustration of the story was avoided.\r\nNevertheless a vague sense of emotional disquietude was revealed in it.\r\nThe two leading persons of the strange idyll, the earnest knight and the\r\npallid maiden, are not yet able themselves to understand how all has\r\ncome to pass--how she, the beggar-maid, should be upon the marble\r\nthrone, and he, the king, kneeling on the steps before her whom he has\r\nexalted to be a queen. They remain motionless and profoundly silent, but\r\ntheir hearts are alive and throbbing. They have feeling which they\r\ncannot comprehend themselves, and the past and present surge through one\r\nanother: life is a dream, and the dream is life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pageant._\r\n\r\n  BURNE-JONES.   THE SEA NYMPH.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nEverything that Burne-Jones has created is at once fragrant, mystical,\r\nand austere, like this picture. His range of subject is most extensive.\r\nIn his _Princess_ Alfred Tennyson had quickened into new life the\r\nlegends of chivalry, and in his _Idylls of the King_ the tales of the\r\nKnights of the Holy Grail. Swinburne published his _Atalanta in\r\nCalydon_, in which he exercised once more the mysterious spell of the\r\nancient drama, while he created in _Chastelard_, _Bothwell_, and _Mary\r\nStuart_ a trilogy of the finest historical tragedies ever written, and\r\nshowed in _Tristram of Lyonesse_ that even Tennyson had not exhausted\r\nall the beauty in old legends of the time of King Arthur; while, as\r\nearly as 1866, he had given to the world his _Poems and Ballads_,\r\ndedicated to Burne-Jones. In these works lie the ideas to which the\r\npainter has given form and colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Portfolio._\r\n\r\n  BURNE-JONES.   THE GOLDEN STAIRS.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nHe paints Circe in a saffron robe, preparing the potion to enchant the\r\ncompanions of Ulysses, with a strange light in her orbs, while two\r\npanthers fawn at her feet. He represents the goddess of Discord at the\r\nmarriage-feast of Thetis, a ghastly, pallid figure, entering amongst the\r\ngods who are celebrating the occasion, and holding the fateful apple in\r\nher hand. He depicts Pygmalion, the artist King of Cyprus, supplicating\r\nAphrodite to breathe life into the sculptured image of a maiden, the\r\nwork of his own hands.\r\n\r\nApart from classical antiquity, he owes some of his inspiration to the\r\nBible and Christian legends, the sublimity of their grave tragedies, and\r\nthe troubled sadness of their yearning and exaltation. One of his\r\nleading works devotes six pictures to the days of creation. An\r\nangel--accompanied in every case by the angels of the previous\r\ndays--carries a sphere, in which may be seen the stars, the waters, the\r\ntrees, the animals, and the first man and woman, in their proper\r\nsequence. The scene of the "Adoration of the Kings" is a landscape where\r\nfragrant roses bloom in the shadow of the slender stems of trees, which\r\nrise straight as a bolt. The Virgin sits in their midst calm and\r\nunapproachable, and in her lap the Child, who is more slender than in\r\nthe pictures of Cimabue. The three Wise Men--tall, gigantic figures,\r\nclad in rich medi\xc3\xa6val garments--approach softly, whilst an angel floats\r\nperpendicularly in the air as a silent witness.\r\n\r\nIn his picture "The Annunciation" Mary is standing motionless beside the\r\ngreat basin of a well-spring, at the portico of her house. To the left\r\nthe messenger of God appears in the air. He has floated solemnly down,\r\nand it seems as if the folds of his robes, which fall straight from the\r\nbody, had hardly been ruffled in his flight, as if his wings had\r\nscarcely moved; with the extremities of his feet he touches the branches\r\nof a laurel. Mary does not shrink, and makes no gesture. There they\r\nstand, gravely, and as still as statues. The robe of the angel is white,\r\nand white that of the Virgin, and white the marble floor and the\r\nwainscoting of the house; and it is only the pinions of the heavenly\r\nmessenger that gleam in a golden brightness. A picture called "Sponsa\r\ndie Libano" bore as a motto the words from _The Song of Solomon_:\r\n"Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that\r\nthe spices thereof may flow out." The bride, in an ample blue robe,\r\nwalks musing beside a stream, upon the bank of which white lilies grow,\r\nwhilst the vehement figures of the North and South Winds rush through\r\nthe air in grey, fluttering garments.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his love for Homer and the Bible, Burne-Jones has a\r\npassion for the old Trouv\xc3\xa8res of the _Chansons de Geste_, the great and\r\nfanciful adventures of vanished chivalry, Proven\xc3\xa7al courts of love, and\r\nthe legends of Arthur, Merlin, and the Knights of the Round Table. His\r\n"Chant d\'Amour" is like a page torn out of an old English or Proven\xc3\xa7al\r\ntale. On the meadow before a medi\xc3\xa6val town a lady is kneeling, a sort of\r\nSt. Cecilia, in a white upper-garment and a gleaming skirt, playing upon\r\nan organ, the full chords of which echo softly through the evening\r\nlandscape. To the left a young knight is sitting upon the ground, and\r\nsilently listens, lost in the music, while a strange figure, clad in\r\nred, is pressing upon the bellows of the instrument. "The Enchantment of\r\nMerlin," with which he made his first appearance in 1877, illustrated\r\nthe passage in the old legend of Merlin and Vivien, relating how it came\r\nto pass one day that she and Merlin entered a forest, which was called\r\nthe forest of Broceliande, and found a glorious wood of whitethorn, very\r\nhigh and all in blossom, and seated themselves in the shadow: and Merlin\r\nfell asleep, and when she saw that he slept she raised herself softly,\r\nand began the spell, exactly according to the teaching of Merlin,\r\ndrawing the magic circle nine times and uttering the spell nine times.\r\nAnd Merlin looked around him, and it seemed to him as though he were\r\nimprisoned in a tower, the highest in the world, and he felt his\r\nstrength leave him as if the blood were streaming from his veins.\r\n\r\nIn other pictures he abandons all attempt to introduce ideas, confining\r\nhimself to the simple grouping of tender girlish figures, by means of\r\nwhich he makes a beautiful composition of the most subtle lines, forms,\r\ncolours, and gestures. The "Golden Stairs" of 1878 was a picture of\r\nthis description: a train of girls, beautiful as angels, descended the\r\nsteps without aim or object, most of them with musical instruments, and\r\nall with the same delicate feet and the same robes falling in beautiful\r\nfolds. In this year he also produced "Venus\' Looking-glass": a number of\r\nnymphs assembled by the side of a clear pool at sunset, in the midst of\r\na sad and solemn landscape, are kneeling by the water\'s edge together,\r\nreflected in its surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNE-JONES.   THE WOOD NYMPH.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nBesides these numerous canvases, mention must be made of the decorative\r\nworks of the master. For the English church in Rome, Burne-Jones has\r\ndesigned decorations in a rich and grave Byzantine style, and in\r\nEngland, where mural decoration has little space accorded to it in\r\nchurches, there is all the more comprehensive scope for painting upon\r\nglass. Until the sixties church windows of this kind were almost\r\nexclusively ordered from Germany. The court dep\xc3\xb4t of glass-painting in\r\nMunich provided for the adornment of Glasgow Cathedral from drawings by\r\nSchwind, Heinrich Hess, and Schraudolph, and for the windows of St.\r\nPaul\'s from designs by Schnorr, while Kaulbach was employed for a public\r\nbuilding in Edinburgh. In these days Burne-Jones reigns over this whole\r\nprovince. Where the German masters handled glass-painting by modernising\r\nit like a Nazarene fresco, Burne-Jones, who has penetrated deeply into\r\nthe medi\xc3\xa6val treatment of form, created a new style in glass-painting,\r\nand one exquisitely in keeping with the Neo-Gothic architecture of\r\nEngland. His most important works of this description are probably the\r\nglass windows which he designed for St. Martin\'s Church and St. Philip\'s\r\nChurch in Birmingham, his native town. These labours of his in the\r\nprovince of Gothic window-painting explain how he came to his style of\r\npainting at the easel: he habituated himself to compose his pictures\r\nwith the architectonical sentiment of a Gothic artist. Forced to satisfy\r\nthe requisitions of the slender, soaring Gothic style, he came to paint\r\nhis tall, straight-lined figures, the composition of which is not\r\ntriangular in the old fashion, but formed in long lines as in vertical\r\nchurch windows.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to find prototypes for every one of these works of\r\nhis. His sibyls recall Pompeii. His church decoration would never have\r\narisen but for the mosaics of Ravenna. And those angels in golden\r\ndrapery with grave, hieratical gestures in the pictures of the\r\nTrecentisti influenced him in his "Days of Creation." Other works of his\r\nsuggest the Etruscan vases or the suavity of Duccio. "Laus Veneris" has\r\nthe severe classicality of Mantegna saturated with Bellini\'s warmth of\r\nhue. The "Chant d\'Amour," in its deep splendour of colour, is like an\r\nidyll by Giorgione. And often he heaps together costly work in gold and\r\nivory like the Florentine goldsmith painters Pollajuolo and Verrochio.\r\nMany of his young girls are of lineal descent from those slender,\r\nflexible, feminine saints of Perugino, painted in sweeping lines and\r\nplanted upon small flat feet. Often, too, when he exaggerates his Gothic\r\nprinciples and gives them eight-and-a-half or nine times the proportion\r\nof their heads, they seem, with their lengthy necks and slim hands fit\r\nfor princesses, like younger sisters of Parmigianino\'s lithe-limbed\r\nwomen; while sometimes their movements have a more ample grace, a more\r\nmajestic nobility, and their lips are moved by the mystical inward smile\r\nof Luini, so unfathomably subtle in its silent reserve. But it is\r\nBotticelli who is most often brought to mind. Burne-Jones has borrowed\r\nfrom him the fine transparent gauze draperies, clinging to the limbs and\r\nbetraying clearly the girlish forms in his pictures; the splendid\r\nmantles, flowered and adorned with dainty patterns of gold; the taste\r\nfor Southern vegetation, for flowers and fruits, and artificial bowers\r\nof thick palm leaves or delicate boughs of cypress, which he delights in\r\nusing as a refined and significant embellishment; from Botticelli he has\r\nborrowed all the attributes with which he has endowed his\r\nangels--rose-garlands and vases, tapers and tall lilies; even his type\r\nof womanhood has an outward resemblance to that of the Florentine, with\r\nits long, delicate, oval face framed in wavy hair, its dreamy eyes and\r\nfinely arched brows, its dainty and rather tip-tilted nose, and its\r\nripe, delicately curving mouth slightly opened. Indeed, Burne-Jones\'s\r\npainting is like one of those gilded flower-tables where plants of all\r\nlatitudes mingle their tendrils and their foliage, their bells and their\r\nclusters, their perfume and their marvellous glory of colour, in a\r\nharmony artificially arranged. In its strained archaism his art is an\r\naffected, artificial art, and would perish as swiftly as a luxuriant\r\nexotic plant, had not this pupil of the Italians been born a\r\nthoroughbred Englishman, and this Botticelli risen from the grave become\r\na true Briton on the banks of the Thames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  STANHOPE.   THE WATERS OF LETHE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRUDWICK.   ELAINE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Berlin Photographic Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nBurne-Jones stands to Botticelli as Botticelli himself stood to the\r\nantique, or as Swinburne to his literary models. As a graceful scholar,\r\nSwinburne has reproduced all styles: the language of the Old Testament,\r\nthe forms of Greek literature, and the na\xc3\xafve lisp of the poets of\r\nchivalry. He decorates his verses with all manner of strange metaphors\r\ndrawn from the literatures of all periods. His _Atalanta in Calydon_ is,\r\ndown to the choruses, an imitation of the Sophoclean tragedies. In his\r\n_Ballad of Life_ he follows the model of the singers who made canzonets,\r\nthe writers who followed Dante and the earliest lyric poets of Italy. In\r\n_Laus Veneris_ he tells the story of Tannh\xc3\xa4user and Dame Venus in the\r\nmanner of the French romantic poets of the sixteenth century; _Saint\r\nDorothy_ is a faithful echo of Chaucer\'s narrative style; and the\r\n_Christmas Carol_ is modelled upon the Proven\xc3\xa7al Ballades. Even the\r\nearliest lyrical mysteries are reproduced in some poems so precisely\r\nthat, so far as form goes, they might be mistaken for originals. But the\r\nthought of Swinburne\'s verse is what no earlier poet would have ever\r\nexpressed. It is inconceivable that a Greek chorus would have chanted\r\nany song of the weariness of man, and of the gifts of grief and tears\r\nbrought to him at his creation; nor would a Greek have written that\r\nHymn to Aphrodite, the deadly flower born of the foam of blood and the\r\nfroth of the sea. And in _Hesperia_, where he describes a man who has\r\nloved beyond measure and suffered over-much amid the mad pleasures of\r\nRome, and now sets out, pale and exhausted, to sail the golden sea of\r\nthe West until he reach the "Fortunate Islands" and find peace before\r\nhis death, the mood does not reflect the thoughts of the old world, but\r\nthose of the close of the nineteenth century; and so it is, too, in his\r\n"Hendecasyllabics," where he complains in classically chiselled diction\r\nof the swift decay of beauty and the hidden ills which of a sudden\r\nconsume the inward force of life. And Burne-Jones treats old myths with\r\nthe same freedom and independence. He takes them up and recasts them,\r\ndiscovers modern passions lying in the very heart of them, enriches them\r\nwith a wealth of delicate shades, borrowed without the smallest ceremony\r\nfrom a new conception of the world and from the life of his own time.\r\nThe human soul grown old looks back, as it were, upon the path which it\r\nhas travelled, and sees the spirit of its own ripe age latent in its\r\ninfancy, recognising that "the child is father of the man." All the\r\nfigures in his pictures are surrounded by a dusk which has nothing in\r\ncommon with the broad daylight in which the Renaissance artists placed\r\nthe antique world. There remains what may be called a residue of modern\r\nfeeling which has not been assimilated to the old myth, a breath of\r\nmagic floating round these figures on their career, something\r\nmysterious, an elusive air of fable. This, indeed, is the pervasive\r\ntemperament and sentiment of our own age. It is our own inward spirit\r\nthat gazes upon us as though from an enchanted mirror with the mien of a\r\nphantom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dixon, photo._\r\n\r\n  STRUDWICK.   THY TUNEFUL STRINGS WAKE MEMORIES.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of W. Imrie, Esq., the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nAnd just as he remodels the entire spirit of old myths, he converts the\r\nfigures which he has borrowed into an artistic form of his own, and,\r\nwithout hesitation, subordinates them in type and physical build and\r\nbearing to the new part they have to play.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  STRUDWICK.   GENTLE MUSIC OF A BYGONE DAY.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of John Dixon, Esq., the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dixon, photo._\r\n\r\n  STRUDWICK.   THE RAMPARTS OF GOD\'S HOUSE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Wm. Imrie, Esq., the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nHis pictures differ in their whole character from those of the masters\r\nof the Quattrocento. In Botticelli, also, the young foliage grows green\r\nand flaunts in its exuberant abundance; but in Burne-Jones the\r\nvegetation suggests one of those immense forests in Sumatra or Java. All\r\nthe plants are luxuriant and resplendent in colour, and seem to swoon in\r\ntheir own opulent, plethoric life. Every tree creates an impression of\r\nhaving shot up in swift and wanton growth under a tropical sun. Rank\r\nparasitic plants trail from stem to stem, and garlands of climbers grow\r\nin a luxuriant tangle round the branches.\r\n\r\nAnd in proportion as the vegetation is luxuriant and sensuous the human\r\nfigures are wasted and languishing. The severe charm, rigidity, and\r\ndemureness of the Quattrocento is weakened into lackadaisical\r\nmelancholy. The dreamy bliss of Botticelli is transposed into sanctified\r\nsolemnity, delicate fragility, a voluptuous lassitude, a gentle\r\nweariness of the world. When he paints ancient sibyls, they are touched\r\nat once by the unearthly asceticism of the Middle Ages seeking refuge\r\nfrom the world, and the melancholy, an\xc3\xa6mic lassitude of the close of the\r\nnineteenth century. If he paints a Venus she does not stand out\r\nvictorious in her nudity, but wears a heavy brocaded robe, and around\r\nher lie the symbols of Christian martyrdom, palms, and perhaps a lyre.\r\nIt is not the fairness of her body that makes her goddess of love, but\r\nonly the dim mystery of her radiant eyes. She is not the Olympian who\r\nentered into frolicsome adventure with the war-god Mars amid the\r\nlaughter of the heavenly gods, for in her conventional humiliation she\r\nis rather like the beautiful d\xc3\xa6mon of the Middle Ages who, upon her\r\njourney into exile, passed by the cross where the Son of Man was\r\nhanging, and tasted all the bitterness of the years. In their delicate\r\nfeatures his Madonnas have a gentle sadness rarely found in the Italian\r\nmasters. Even the angels, who were roguish and wayward in the\r\nQuattrocento, do their spiriting with ceremonious gravity, and a subdued\r\nmelancholy underlies their devotional reverence. In Botticelli they are\r\nfresh, youthful figures, lightly girdled, and with fluttering locks and\r\nswelling robes and limber bodies, whether they float around the Madonna\r\nin blissful revelry or look up to the Child Christ in their rapt\r\necstasy. But in Burne-Jones they are devout, sombre, deeply earnest\r\nbeings, gazing as thoughtfully and dreamily as though they had already\r\nknown all the affliction of the world. Their limbs seem paralysed, and\r\ntheir gesture weary. It is not possible to look at one of his pictures\r\nwithout being reminded of the Florentines of the fifteenth century, and\r\nyet the spectator at once recognises that they are the work of\r\nBurne-Jones. He is even opposed to Rossetti, his lord and master,\r\nthrough this element of melancholy: the intoxication of opium is\r\nfollowed by the sober awakening.\r\n\r\nRossetti\'s women are dazzling and glorious figures of a modern and\r\ndeliberately cruel beauty--sisters of Messalina, Ph\xc3\xa6dra, and Faustina.\r\nHe delineates them as luxuriant beings with supple and splendid bodies,\r\nlong white necks, and snowily gleaming breasts; with full and fragrant\r\nhair, ardent, yearning eyes, and demoniacally passionate lips. Their\r\nmother is the Venus Verticordia whom Rossetti so often painted. Cruel in\r\ntheir love as one of the blind forces of nature, they are like that\r\nwater-sprite with her song and her red coral mouth dragged from the sea\r\nin a fishing-net, as an old French _fabliau_ tells, and so fair that\r\nevery man who beheld her was seized by the love of her, but died when he\r\nclasped her in his arms. What they love in man is his physical strength,\r\nhis face and sinews of bronze. Only the strong man who loves them with\r\noverpowering madness, like a stormy wind, can bend them to his will.\r\nSwinburne has sung of "the lips intertwisted and bitten, where the foam\r\nis as blood," of\r\n\r\n  "The heavy white limbs and the cruel\r\n   Red mouth like a venomous flower."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dixon, photo._\r\n\r\n  STRUDWICK.   THE TEN VIRGINS.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of William Imrie, Esq., the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nBut the women of Burne-Jones know that this fervour is no longer to be\r\nfound upon the earth. The blood has been sapped, and the fire burns low,\r\nand the glorious, ancient might of love has disappeared. For these women\r\nlife has lost its sunshine, and love its passion, and the world its\r\nhopes. The hue of their cheeks is pallid, their eyes are dim, their\r\nbodies sickly and without flesh and blood, and their hips are spare.\r\nWith pale, quivering lips, and a melancholy smile or a strangely\r\nresigned, intensely grieved look flickering at the corners of their\r\nmouths, they live consumed by sterile longing, and pine in silent\r\ndejection, gazing into vacant space like imprisoned goldfish, or\r\nluxuriate in the vague Fata Morgana of an over-delicate, over-refined,\r\nand bashfully tremulous eroticism--\r\n\r\n  "And the chaplets of old are above us,\r\n     And the oyster-bed teems out of reach;\r\n   Old poets outsing and outlove us,\r\n     And Catullus makes mouths at our speech.\r\n   Who shall kiss in the father\'s own city,\r\n     With such lips as he sang with again?\r\n   Intercede with us all of thy pity,\r\n     Our Lady of Pain."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Portfolio._\r\n\r\n  CRANE.   THE CHARIOTS OF THE FLEETING HOURS.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nSwinburne\'s first ardent and sensuous volume of lyrics contains a poem,\r\n_The Garden of Proserpine_: it tells how a man weary of all things human\r\nand divine, and no longer able to support the intoxicating fragrance of\r\nthe roses of Aphrodite, draws near with wavering steps to the throne\r\nwhere calm Proserpine sits silent, crowned with cold white flowers. And\r\nin the same way Rossetti\'s flaming and quivering passion and his\r\nvolcanic desire end in Burne-Jones with sad resignation.\r\n\r\nWhilst Christianity and Hellenism mingle in the figures of Burne-Jones,\r\na division of labour is noticeable amongst the following artists: some\r\naddressed themselves exclusively to the treatment of ancient subjects,\r\nothers to ecclesiastical romantic painting in the style of the\r\nQuattrocento, and others again recognised their chief vocation in\r\ninitiating a reformation in kindred provinces of industrial art.\r\n\r\n_R. Spencer Stanhope_, who was at Oxford, like Burne-Jones, and, indeed,\r\nreceived his first artistic impulses while employed on the elaboration\r\nof Rossetti\'s mural pictures for the Union, worked even in later days\r\nchiefly in the field of decorative painting, and is, with Burne-Jones,\r\nthe principal designer for the interior decoration of churches in\r\nEngland. His oil-paintings are few, and in their gracious Quattrocento\r\nbuild they are in outward appearance scarcely different from those of\r\nBurne-Jones. In a picture belonging to the Manchester Gallery there is a\r\nmaiden seated amid a flowery meadow, while a small Cupid with red\r\npinions draws near to her; the landscape has an air of peace and\r\nhappiness. Another picture--probably inspired by Catullus\' _Lament for\r\nLesbia\'s Sparrow_--displays a girl sitting upon an old town wall with a\r\nlittle dead bird. "The Temptation of Eve" is like a brilliantly coloured\r\nmedi\xc3\xa6val miniature, painted with the greatest _finesse_. As in the\r\nwoodcut in the Cologne Bible, Paradise is enclosed with a circular red\r\nwall. Eve is like a slim, twisted Gothic statue. Like Burne-Jones,\r\nStanhope is always delicate and poetic, but he is less successful in\r\nsetting upon old forms of art the stamp of his individuality, and thus\r\ngiving them new life and a character of their own. In their severe,\r\narch\xc3\xa6ological character his pictures have little beyond the affectation\r\nof a style which has been arrived at through imitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALTER CRANE.   FROM _THE TEMPEST_.]\r\n\r\nThe third member of this Oxford Circle, the poet _William Morris_, has\r\nexercised great influence over English taste by the institution of an\r\nindustrial establishment for embroidery, painting upon glass, and\r\nhousehold decoration. Keeping in mind that close union which existed in\r\nthe fifteenth century between art and the manual crafts, he and certain\r\nof his disciples did not hesitate to provide designs for decorative\r\nstuffs, wall-papers, furniture, and household embellishments of every\r\ndescription. They were largely indebted to the Japanese, to say nothing\r\nof the old Italians, though they succeeded in creating a thoroughly\r\nmodern and independent style, in spite of all they borrowed. The whole\r\nrange of industrial art in England received a new lease of life, and\r\nhousehold decoration became blither and more cheerful in its\r\nappearance. Only light, delicate, and finely graduated colours were\r\nallowed to predominate, and they were combined with slender, graceful,\r\nand vivacious form. The heavy panelling which was popular in the sixties\r\ngave way to bright papers ornamented with flowers; narrow panes made way\r\nfor large plate-glass windows with light curtains, in which long-stemmed\r\nflowers were entwined in the pattern. Slim pillars supported cabinets\r\npainted in exquisite hues or gleaming with lacquer-work and enamel.\r\nSeats were ornamented with soft cushions shining in all the delicate\r\nsplendour of Indian silks. And the pre-Raphaelite style of ornamentation\r\nwas even extended to the embellishment of books, so that England created\r\nthe modern book, at a time when other nations adhered altogether to the\r\nimitation of old models.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALTER CRANE.   FROM _THE TEMPEST_.]\r\n\r\nIn his early years _Arthur Hughes_ attracted much attention by an\r\nOphelia, a delicate, thoroughly English figure of soft pre-Raphaelite\r\ngrace; but in later years he rarely got beyond sentimental Renaissance\r\nmaidens suggestive of Julius Wolff, and humorous work in the style of\r\n_genre_.\r\n\r\n_J. N. Strudwick_, who worked first under Spencer Stanhope and then\r\nunder Burne-Jones, was more consistent in his fidelity to the\r\npre-Raphaelite principles. His pictures have the same delicate,\r\nenervated mysticism, and the same thoughtful, dreamy poetry, as those of\r\nhis elders in the school. By preference he paints slender, pensive\r\ngirlish figures, with the sentiment of Burne-Jones, taking his motive\r\nfrom some passage in a poet. In a picture called "Elaine" the heroine is\r\nmournfully seated in a lofty room of a medi\xc3\xa6val palace. Another of his\r\nworks reveals three girls occupied with music. Or a knight strewn with\r\nroses lies asleep in a maiden\'s lap. Or again, there is St. Cecilia\r\nstanding with her Seraphina before a Roman building. Strudwick does not\r\npossess the spontaneity of his master. The childlike, angular effect at\r\nwhich he aims often seems slightly weak and mawkish; and occasionally\r\nhis painting is somewhat diffident, especially when he paints in the\r\narchitectural detail and rich artistic accessories, and stipples with a\r\nvery fine brush. But his works are so exquisite and delicate, so\r\nprecious and \xc3\xa6sthetic, that they must be reckoned amongst the most\r\ncharacteristic performances of the New pre-Raphaelitism. One of his\r\nlarger compositions he has named "Bygone Days." There is a man musing\r\nover the memories of his life, as he sits upon a white marble throne in\r\nfront of a long white marble wall, amid an evening landscape. He\r\nstretches out his arms after the vanished years of his youth, the years\r\nwhen love smiled upon him; but Time, a winged figure like Orcagna\'s\r\n_Morte_, divides him from the goddess of love, swinging his scythe with\r\na threatening gesture. "The Past," a slender matron in a black robe,\r\ncovers her face lamenting. In Strudwick\'s most celebrated picture, "The\r\nRamparts of God\'s House," there is a man standing at the threshold of\r\nheaven, naked as a Greek athlete. His earthly fetters lie shattered at\r\nhis feet. Angels receive him, marvellously spiritual beings filled with\r\na lovely simplicity and revealing ineffable profundity of soul, beings\r\nwho partake of Fra Angelico almost as much as of Ellen Terry. Their\r\nexpression is quiet and peaceful. Instead of marvelling at the\r\nnew-comer, they gaze with their eyes green as a water-sprite\'s\r\nmeditatively into illimitable space. The architecture in the background\r\nis entirely symbolical, as in the pictures of Giotto. A little house\r\nwith a golden roof and gilded medi\xc3\xa6val reliefs is inhabited by a dense\r\nthrong of little angels, as if it were a Noah\'s-ark. The colour is rich\r\nand sonorous, as in the youthful works of Carlo Crivelli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G. F. WATTS IN HIS GARDEN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission, from a photograph by A. Frazer-Tytler, Esq._)]\r\n\r\n_Henry Holliday_, who has of late devoted himself largely to decorative\r\ntasks, seems in these works to be the _juste-milieu_ between Burne-Jones\r\nand Leighton. And the youngest representative of this group tinged with\r\nreligious and romantic feelings is _Marie Spartali-Stillman_, who lives\r\nin Rome and paints as a rule pictures from Dante, Boccaccio, and\r\nPetrarch, after the fashion of Rossetti.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  WATTS.   LADY LINDSAY.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Lady Lindsay, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nOthers, who turned to the treatment of antique subjects, were led by\r\nthese themes more towards the Idealism of the Cinquecento as regards the\r\nform of their work; and in this way they lost the severe stamp of the\r\npre-Raphaelites.\r\n\r\nIn these days _William Blake Richmond_, in particular, no longer shows\r\nany trace of having once belonged to the mystic circle of Oxonians. The\r\nAriadne which he painted in the old days was a lean and tall woman with\r\nfluttering black mantle, casting up her arms in lamentation and gazing\r\nout of those deep, gazelle-like eyes which Burne-Jones gave his Vivien.\r\nEven the scheme of colour was harmonised in the bronze, olive tone which\r\nmarked the earliest works of Burne-Jones. But soon afterwards his views\r\nunderwent a complete revolution in Italy. Influenced by Alma Tadema in\r\nform, and by the French in colour, he drew nearer to the academic\r\nmanner, until he became, at length, a Classicist without any salient\r\npeculiarity. The allegory "Amor Vincit Omnia" is characteristic of this\r\nphase of his art. Aphrodite, risen from her bath, is standing naked in a\r\nGrecian portico, through which a purple sea is visible. Her maidens are\r\nbusied in dressing her; and they are, one and all, chaste and noble\r\nfigures of that classic grace and elegant fluency of line which Leighton\r\nusually lends to his ideal forms. In a picture which became known in\r\nGermany through the International Exhibition of 1891, Venus, a clear and\r\nwhite figure, floats down with stately motion towards Anchises. It is\r\nonly in the delicate pictures of children which have been his chief\r\nsuccesses of late years that he is still fresh and direct. Girls with\r\nthick hair of a _blonde cendr\xc3\xa9e_, finely moulded lips, and large\r\ngazelle-like eyes full of sensibility, are seen in these works dreamily\r\nseated in white or blue dresses against a red or a blue curtain. And the\r\n\xc3\xa6sthetic method of painting, which almost suggests pastel work in its\r\ndelicacy, is in keeping with the ethereal figures and the bloom of\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n_Walter Crane_ has been far more successful in uniting the\r\npre-Raphaelite conception with a sentiment for beauty formed upon the\r\nantique, Burne-Jones\'s "paucity of flesh and plenitude of feeling" with\r\na measured nobility of form. Born in Liverpool in 1845, he received his\r\nfirst impressions of art at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1857, where\r\nhe saw Millais\' "Sir Isumbras at the Ford." The chivalrous poetry of\r\nthis master became the ideal of his youth, and it rings clearly\r\nthroughout his first pictures, exhibited in 1862. One of these has as\r\nits subject "The Lady of Shalott" approaching the shore of her\r\nmysterious island in a boat, and the other St. George slaying the\r\ndragon. Meanwhile, however, he had come to know Walker, through W. J.\r\nLinton, the wood-engraver, for whom he worked from 1859 to 1862, and the\r\nformer led him to admire the beauty of the sculptures of the Parthenon.\r\nAfter this he passed from romantic to antique subjects, and there is\r\nsomething notably youthful, a fresh bloom as of old legends, in these\r\ncompositions, which recall the sculpture of Phidias. "The Bridge of\r\nLife," belonging to the year 1875, was like an antique gem or a Grecian\r\nbas-relief. At the Paris World Exhibition of 1878 he had a "Birth of\r\nVenus," noble and antique in composition, and of a severity of form\r\nwhich suggested Mantegna. The suave and poetic single figures which he\r\ndelights in painting are at once Greek and English: girls, with branches\r\nof blossom, in white drapery falling into folds, and enveloping their\r\nwhole form while indicating every line of the body. His "Pegasus" might\r\nhave come straight from the frieze of the Parthenon. "The Fleeting\r\nHours" at once recalls Guido Reni\'s "Aurora" and D\xc3\xbcrer\'s apocalyptic\r\nriders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cameron, photo._\r\n\r\n  WATTS.   HOPE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pageant._\r\n\r\n  WATTS.   PAOLO AND FRANCESCA.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cameron, photo._\r\n\r\n  WATTS.   LOVE AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nLater he turned to decorative painting, like all the representatives of\r\nthe pre-Raphaelite group. He is one of the most original designers for\r\nindustrial work in tapestry, next to Morris the most influential leader\r\nof the English arts and crafts, and he has collaborated in founding that\r\nmodern naturalistic tendency of style which will be the art of the\r\nfuture. His designs are always based upon naturalistic motives--the\r\nEnglish type of womanhood and the English splendour of flowers. There\r\nalways predominates a sensitive relationship between the \xc3\xa6sthetic\r\ncharacter of the forms and their symbolical significance. He always\r\nadapts an object of nature so that it may correspond in style with the\r\nmaterial in which he works. The way in which he makes use of the noblest\r\nmodels of antiquity and of the Renaissance, and yet immediately\r\ntransposes them into an English key of sentiment and into available\r\nmodern forms, is entirely peculiar. And last, but not least, he is a\r\nmarvellous illustrator. Every one went wild with delight at the close of\r\nthe sixties over the appearance of his first children\'s books, _The\r\nFaerie Queene_, _The Little Pig who went to Market_, and _King\r\nLuckiboy_, the pictures of which were soon displayed upon all patterns\r\nfor embroidery. And they were followed by others: after 1875 he\r\npublished _Tell me a Story_, _The First of May--a Fairy Masque_, _The\r\nSirens Three_, _Echoes of Hellas_, and so forth. The two albums _The\r\nBaby\'s Bouquet_ and _The Baby\'s Opera_ of 1879 are probably the finest\r\nof them all.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their childish subjects, the drawings of Walter Crane have\r\nsuch a monumental air that they have the effect of "grand painting."\r\nWithout imitation he reproduces spontaneously the grace and character of\r\nthe primitive Florentines. Some of his plates recall "The Dream of\r\nPolifilo," and might bear the monogram of Giovanni Bellini. They owe\r\ntheir origin to a profound Germanic sentiment mingled with pagan\r\nreminiscences; they are an almost Grecian and yet English art, where\r\nfancy like a foolish, dreamy child plays with a brilliant skein of forms\r\nand colours.\r\n\r\nThat great artist _George Frederick Watts_ stands quite apart as a\r\npersonality in himself. In point of substance he is divided from others\r\nby not leaning upon poets, but by inventing independent allegories for\r\nhimself; and in point of form by courting neither the Quattrocento nor\r\nthe Roman Cinquecento, but rather following the Venice of the later\r\nRenaissance. Instead of the marble precision of Squarcione or Mantegna,\r\nwhat predominates in his work is something soft and melting, which might\r\nrecall Correggio, Tintoretto, or Giorgione, were it not that there is a\r\ncooler grey, a subdued light fresco tone in Watts, in place of the\r\nVenetian glory of colour.\r\n\r\nAs a man, Watts was one of those artists who are only to be found in\r\nEngland--an artist who, from his youth upwards, has been able to live\r\nfor his art without regard to profit. Born in London in the year 1820,\r\nhe left the Academy after being a pupil there for a brief period, and\r\nbegan to visit the Elgin Room in the British Museum. The impression made\r\nupon him by the sculptures of the Parthenon was decisive for his whole\r\nlife. Not merely are numerous plastic works due to his study of them,\r\nbut several of his finest paintings. When he was seventeen he exhibited\r\nhis first pictures, which were painted very delicately and with\r\nscrupulous pains; and in 1843 he took part in the competition for the\r\nfrescoes of the Houses of Parliament, amongst which the representation\r\nof St. George and the Dragon was from his hand. With the proceeds of the\r\nprize which he received at the competition he went to Italy, and there\r\nhe came to regard the great Venetians Titian and Giorgione as his kin\r\nand his contemporaries. The pupil of Phidias became the worshipper of\r\nTintoretto. In Italy he produced "Fata Morgana," a picture of a warrior\r\nvainly catching at the airy white veil of a nude female figure which\r\nfloats past. This work already displays him as an accomplished artist,\r\nthough it is wanting in the large, Classical tranquillity of his later\r\npaintings. He returned home with plans demanding more than human energy.\r\nLike the Frenchman Chenavard, he cherished the purpose of representing\r\nthe history of the world in a series of frescoes, which were to adorn\r\nthe walls of a building specially adapted for the purpose. "Chaos," "The\r\nCreation," "The Temptation of Man," "The Penitence," "The Death of\r\nAbel," and "The Death of Cain" were the earliest pictures which he\r\ndesigned for the series. It was through fresco painting alone, as he\r\nbelieved, that it was possible to school English art to monumental\r\ngrandeur, nobleness, and simplicity. But it was not possible for him to\r\nremain long upon this path in England, where painting has but little\r\nspace accorded to it upon the walls of churches, while in other public\r\nbuildings decoration is not in demand. Moreover, it is doubtful whether\r\nWatts would have achieved anything great in this province of art. At any\r\nrate, a work which he executed for the dining-hall at Lincoln\'s Inn--an\r\nassembly of the lawgivers of all times from Moses down to Edward I--is\r\nscarcely more than a mixture of Raphael\'s "School of Athens" and the\r\n"Hemicycle" of Delaroche. In magnificent allegories in the form of\r\noil-paintings he first found the expression of his individuality. Like\r\nTurner, Watts did not paint pictures for sale. Yet he has lent one or\r\nother of his pictures to almost every public exhibition. A whole room is\r\ndevoted to him in the Tate Gallery. But to know his work thoroughly one\r\nhad to go to his house. His studio in Little Holland House contained\r\nalmost all his important creations, and was visited by the public upon\r\nSaturday and Sunday afternoons as freely as if it were a museum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pageant._\r\n\r\n  WATTS.   ARIADNE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. F. Hollyer, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  WATTS.   ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nAs a landscape painter Watts is a visionary like Turner, though in\r\naddition to the purely artistic effect of his pictures he always\r\nendeavoured to awaken remoter feelings and ideas of some kind or\r\nanother. His landscape "Corsica" reveals a grey expanse, with very\r\nslight vibrations of tone which suggest that out to sea a distant island\r\nis emerging from the mist. His "Mount Ararat," a picture entirely filled\r\nwith the play of light blue tones, represents a number of barren rocky\r\ncones bathed in the intense blue of a pure transparent starry night.\r\nAbove the highest peak there is one star sparkling more brilliantly than\r\nthe others. In his "Deluge: the Forty-first Day," he attempted to\r\ndepict, after an interpretation of his own, the power "with which light\r\nand heat, dissipating the darkness and dissolving the multitude of the\r\nwaters into mist and vapour, give new life to perished nature." What is\r\nactually placed before the eye is a delicate symphony of colours which\r\nwould have delighted Turner: wild, agitated sea, clouds gleaming like\r\nliquid gold, and mist behind which the sun rises in a magical glow, like\r\na red ball of fire.\r\n\r\nIn his portraits he is earnest and sincere. Just as fifty years ago\r\nDavid d\'Angers devoted half a lifetime to getting together a portrait\r\ngallery of famous contemporaries, so to Watts belongs the glory of\r\nhaving really been the historian of his time. The collection of\r\nportraits, many of which are to be seen in the National Portrait\r\nGallery, comprises about forty likenesses, all of them half-length\r\npictures, all of them upon the same scale of size, all of them\r\nrepresenting very famous men. Amongst the poets comprised in this\r\ngallery of genius are Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning, Matthew Arnold,\r\nSwinburne, William Morris, and Sir Henry Taylor; amongst prose-writers,\r\nCarlyle, John Stuart Mill, Lecky, Motley, and Leslie Stephen; amongst\r\nstatesmen, Gladstone, Sir Charles Dilke, the Duke of Argyll, Lord\r\nSalisbury, Lord Shaftesbury, Lord Lyndhurst, and Lord Sherbrooke;\r\namongst the leaders of the clergy, Dean Stanley, Dean Milman, Cardinal\r\nManning, and Dr. Martineau; amongst painters, Rossetti, Millais,\r\nLeighton, Burne-Jones, and Calderon; and amongst notable foreigners,\r\nGuizot, Thiers, Joachim the violinist, and many others. In the matter of\r\ntechnique Watts is excelled by many of the French. His portraits have\r\nsomething heavy, nor are they eminent either for softness of modelling,\r\nor for that momentary and animated effect peculiar to Lenbach. But few\r\nportraits belonging to the nineteenth century have the same force of\r\nexpression, the same straightforward sureness of aim, the same grandeur\r\nand simplicity. Before each of the persons represented one is able to\r\nsay, That is a painter, that a poet, and that a scholar. All the\r\nself-conscious dignity of a President of the Royal Academy is expressed\r\nin the picture of Leighton, and his look is as cold as marble; while the\r\neyes of Burne-Jones seem mystically veiled, as though they were gazing\r\ninto the past. Indeed, the way in which Watts grasps his characters is\r\nmasterly beyond conception. Amongst the old painters Tintoretto and\r\nMoroni might be compared with him most readily, while Van Dyck is the\r\nleast like him of all.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the poetic fantasy of Burne-Jones dallying with\r\nlegendary lore, an element of brooding thought is characteristic of the\r\nlarge compositions of Watts, a meditative absorption in ideas which\r\nprovoke the intellect to further activity by their mysterious\r\nallegorical suggestions. Just as he makes an approach to the old\r\nVenetians in external form, he is divided from them in the inward burden\r\nof his work by a severity and hardiness characteristic of the Northern\r\nspirit, a predominance of idea seldom met with amongst Southern masters,\r\nand a profoundly sad way of thought in which one sees the stamp of the\r\nnineteenth century. Apart from the purely artistic effect of his work,\r\nhe tried to make his pictures serve as a stimulus to deeper thought and\r\nmeditation: "The end of art," he writes, "must be the exposition of some\r\nweighty principle of spiritual significance, the illustration of a great\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"The Spirit of Christianity," the only one of his works which has a\r\nreligious tone, displays a youth throned upon the clouds, with children\r\nnestling at his feet. His powerful head is bent upwards, and his right\r\nhand opened wide. In "Orpheus and Eurydice" he has chosen the moment\r\nwhen Orpheus turns round to behold Eurydice turning pale and sinking to\r\nthe earth, to be once more swallowed by Hades. The lyre drops from his\r\nhands, and with a gesture of despair he draws the form of his wife to\r\nhis heart in a last, eternal embrace. "Artemis and Endymion" is a scene\r\nin which a tall female figure in silvery shining vesture bends over the\r\nsleeping shepherd, throwing herself into the curve of a sickle.\r\n\r\nBut, as a rule, he neither makes use of Christian nor of ancient ideas,\r\nbut embodies his own thoughts. In "The Illusions of Life," a picture\r\nbelonging to the year 1847, beautiful, dreamy figures hover over a gulf,\r\nspreading at the verge of existence. At their feet lie the shattered\r\nemblems of greatness and power, and upon a small strip of the earth\r\nhanging over an abyss those illusions are visible which have not yet\r\nbeen destroyed: Glory, in the shape of a knight in harness, chases the\r\nbubble of resounding fame; Love is symbolised by a pair who are tenderly\r\nembracing; Learning, by an old man poring over manuscripts in the dusk;\r\nInnocence, by a child grasping at a butterfly. "The Angel of Death" is a\r\npicture of a winged and mighty woman throned at the entrance of a way\r\nwhich leads to eternity. Upon her knees there rests, covered with a\r\nwhite cloth, the corpse of a new-born child. Men and women of every\r\nstation lay reverently down at the feet of the angel the symbols of\r\ntheir dignity and the implements of their earthly toil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  WATTS.   ARTEMIS AND ENDYMION.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Mr. Robert Dunthorne, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\n"Love and Death" represents the two great sovereigns of the world\r\nwrestling together for a human life. With steps which have a mysterious\r\nmajesty, pallid Death draws near, demanding entrance at the door of a\r\nhouse, whilst Love, a slight, boyish figure with bright wings, places\r\nhimself in the way; but with one great, irresistible gesture the mighty\r\ngenius of Death sweeps the shrinking child to one side. In another\r\npicture, "Love and Life," the genius of Love, in the form of a slim,\r\npowerful youth, helps poor, weak, clinging Life, a half-grown, timid,\r\nfaltering girl, to clamber up the stony path of a mountain, over which\r\nthe sun rises golden. "Hope" is a picture in which a tender spirit,\r\nbathed in the blue mist, sits upon the globe, blindfold, listening in\r\nbliss to the low sound vibrating from the last string of her harp.\r\n"Mammon" is embodied by Watts in a coarse and bloated satyr brutally\r\nsetting his heel upon a youth and a young girl, as upon a footstool.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, when the committee of the Munich Exhibition were moved by the\r\nwritings of Cornelius Gurlitt to have some of these works sent over to\r\nGermany, a certain disappointment was felt in artistic circles. And any\r\none who is accustomed to gauge pictures by their technique is justified\r\nin missing the genuine pictorial temperament in Watts. The sobriety of\r\nhis scheme of colour, his preference for subdued tones, his distaste for\r\nall "dexterity" and freedom from all calculated refinement, are not in\r\naccord with the desires of our time. Even his sentiment is altogether\r\nopposed to that which predominates in the other New Idealists.\r\nBurne-Jones and Rossetti found sympathy because their repining lyricism,\r\ntheir psychopathic subtlety, their wonderful mixture of archaic\r\nsimplicity and _d\xc3\xa9cadent hautgo\xc3\xbbt_, stand in direct touch with the\r\npresent. Watts\' pictures seem cold and wanting in temperament because he\r\nmade no appeal to the vibrating life of the nerves.\r\n\r\nBut the same sort of criticism was written by the younger generation in\r\nGermany, seventy years ago, on the works of Goethe, which have, none the\r\nless, remained fresher than those of Schlegel and Tieck. What is modern\r\nis not always the same as what is eternally young. And if one\r\nendeavours, disregarding the current of the age, to approach Watts as\r\nthough he were an old master, one feels an increasing sense of the\r\nprobability that amongst all the New Idealists of the present he has,\r\nnext to Boecklin, the best prospect of becoming one. In spite of all its\r\nindependence of spirit, the art of Burne-Jones has an affected mannerism\r\nin its outward garb. The sentiment of it is free, but the form is\r\nconfined in the old limits. And it is not impossible that later\r\ngenerations, to whom his specifically modern sentiment will appeal more\r\nand more faintly, may one day rank him, on account of his archaism in\r\ndrawing, as much amongst the eclectics as Overbeck and F\xc3\xbchrich are held\r\nto be at the present time. But that can never happen to Watts. His works\r\nare the expression of an artist who is as little dependent upon the past\r\nas upon the momentary tendencies of the present. His articulation of\r\nform has nothing in common with the lines of beauty of the antique, or\r\nthe Quattrocento, or the Cinquecento. It is a thing created by himself\r\nand to himself peculiar. He needs no erudition, and no attributes and\r\nsymbols borrowed from the Renaissance, to body forth his allegories.\r\nWith him there begins a new power of creating types; and his figure of\r\nDeath--that tall woman, clad in white, with hollow cheeks, livid face,\r\nand lifeless sunken eyes--is no less cogent than the genius with the\r\ntorch reversed or the burlesque skeleton of the Middle Ages. Moreover,\r\nthere is in his works a trace of profundity and simple grandeur which\r\nstands alone in our own period. It is precisely our more sensitive\r\nnervous system which divides us from the old painters, and has generally\r\ngiven the artistic productions of our day a disturbed, capricious,\r\nrestless, and overstrained character, making them inferior to those of\r\nthe old masters.\r\n\r\nWatts is, perhaps, the only painter who can bear comparison with them in\r\nevery respect. Here is a man who has been able to live in himself far\r\naway from the bustle of exhibitions, a man who worked when he was old as\r\nsoundly and freshly as when he was young, a man, also, who is always\r\nsimple in his art, lucid, earnest, grandiose, impressive, and of\r\nmonumental sublimity. Though he shows no trace of imitation he might\r\nhave come straight from the Renaissance, so deep is his sense of beauty,\r\nso direct and so condensed his power of giving form to his ideas. And\r\namongst living painters I should find it impossible to name a single one\r\nwho could embody such a scene as that of "Love and Death" so calmly, so\r\nentirely without rhetorical gestures and all the tricks of theatrical\r\nmanagement. There is the mark of style about everything in Watts, and it\r\nis no external and borrowed style, but one which is his own, a style\r\nwhich a notable man, a thinker and a poet, has fashioned for the\r\nexpression of his own ideas. That is what makes him a master of\r\ncontemporary painting and of the painting of all times. And that is what\r\nwill, perhaps, render him, in the eyes of later generations, one of the\r\ngreatest men of our time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW IDEALISM IN FRANCE AND GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nA similar change of taste occurred in France. Just as the Impressionists\r\nhad held modernity alone in high honour, so now awoke the longing after\r\nthe faded lustre of a bygone age of beauty. The younger generation in\r\nliterature began to do homage to their spiritual ancestors not in Zola\r\nbut in Charles Baudelaire, that abstracter of the quintessence; and\r\nsimilarly in the province of art there came to the fore two of the older\r\nmasters who until then had been relegated to the background.\r\n\r\nIn pictorial art _Gustave Moreau_ is equivalent to Charles Baudelaire.\r\nCertain of the strange and fascinating poems in the _Fleurs du Mal_\r\nstrike alone the same note of sentiment as the tortured, subtilised,\r\nmorbid, but mysterious and captivating creations of Moreau; and his\r\nfigures, like those of Baudelaire, live in a mysterious world, and\r\nstimulate the spirit like eternal riddles. Every one of his works stands\r\nin need of a commentary; every one of them bears witness to a profound\r\nand peculiar activity of mind, and every one of them is full of intimate\r\nreveries. Every agitation of his inward spirit takes shape in myths of\r\nhieratical strangeness, in mysterious hallucinations, which he sets in\r\nhis pictures like jewels. He gives ear to dying strains, rising faintly,\r\ninaudible to the majority of men. Marvellous beings pass before him,\r\nfantastic and yet earnest; forms of legendary story hover through space\r\nupon strange animals; a fabulous hippogriff bears him far away to Greece\r\nand the East, to vanished worlds of beauty. Upon the journey he beholds\r\nUtopias, beholds the Fortunate Islands, and visits all lands, borne upon\r\nthe pinions of a dream. An age which went wild over Cabanel and\r\nBouguereau could not possibly be in sympathy with him. The Naturalists,\r\nalso, looked upon him as a singular being; it was much as if an Indian\r\nmagician whose robe shone in all the hues of the rainbow had suddenly\r\nmade his appearance at a ball, amongst men in black evening dress. It is\r\nonly since the mysterious smile of Leonardo\'s feminine figures has once\r\nmore drawn the world beneath its spell that the spirit of Moreau\'s\r\npictures has become a familiar thing. Even his schooling was different\r\nfrom that of his contemporaries. He was the only pupil of that strange\r\nartist Th\xc3\xa9odore Chass\xc3\xa9riau, and Chass\xc3\xa9riau had directed him to the study\r\nof Bellini, Mantegna, Leonardo da Vinci, and all those enchanting\r\nprimitive artists whose enchanting female figures are seen to move\r\nthrough mysterious black and blue landscapes. He was then seized with an\r\nenthusiasm for the hieratical art of India. And he was also affected by\r\nold German copper-engraving, old Venetian pottery, painting upon vases\r\nand enamel, mosaics and niello work, tapestries and old Oriental\r\nminiatures. His exquisite and expressive style, which, at a time when\r\nthe flowing Cinquecento manner was in vogue, made an unpleasant effect\r\nby its archaic angularity, was the result of the fusion of these\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nWhen he appeared, the special characteristic of French art was its\r\nseeking after violent agitations of the spirit, _\xc3\xa9motions fortes_. The\r\nspirit was to be roused by stormy vehemence, as a relaxed system is\r\nbraced by massage. But the generation at the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury wanted to be soothed rather than stirred by painting. It could\r\nnot endure shrill cries, loud, emphatic speech, or vehement gestures. It\r\ndesired subdued and refined emotions, and Moreau\'s distinction is that\r\nhe was the first to give expression to this weary _d\xc3\xa9cadent_ humour. In\r\nhis work a complete absence of motion has taken the place of the\r\nstriding legs, the attitudes of the fencing-master, the arms\r\neverlastingly raised to heaven, and the passionately distorted faces\r\nwhich had reigned in French painting since David. He makes spiritual\r\nexpression his starting-point, and not scenic effect; he keeps, as it\r\nwere, within the laws which rule over classical sculpture, where\r\nvehemence was only permitted to intrude from the period of decline, from\r\nthe Pergamene reliefs, the Laoco\xc3\xb6n, and the Farnese Bull. Everything\r\nbears the seal of sublime peace; everything is inspired by inward life\r\nand suppressed passion. Even when the gods fight there are no mighty\r\ngestures; with a mere frown they can shake the earth like Zeus.\r\n\r\nHis spiritual conception of the old myths is just as peculiar as his\r\ngrave articulation of form; it is a conception such as earlier\r\ngenerations could not have, one which alone befits the spiritual\r\ncondition of the close of the nineteenth century. During the most recent\r\ndecades arch\xc3\xa6ological excavations and scientific researches have widened\r\nand deepened our conceptions of the old mythology in a most unexpected\r\nmanner. Beside the laughter of the Grecian Pan we hear the sighs and\r\nbehold the convulsions of Asia, in her anguish bearing gods, who perish\r\nyoung like spring flowers, in the loving arms of Oriental goddesses. We\r\nhave heard of chryselephantine statues covered with precious stones from\r\ntop to bottom; and we know the graceful terra-cotta figures of Tanagra.\r\nBefore there was a knowledge of the Tanagra statuettes no arch\xc3\xa6ologist\r\ncould have believed that the Eros of Hesiod was such a charming, wayward\r\nlittle rascal. Before the discovery of the Cyprus statues no artist\r\nwould have ventured to adorn a Grecian goddess with flowers, pins for\r\nthe head, and a heavy tiara. Prompted by these discoveries, Moreau has\r\nbeen swayed by strangely rich inspirations. He is said to have worked in\r\nhis studio as in a tower opulent with ivory and jewels. He has a delight\r\nin arraying the figures of his legends in the most costly materials, as\r\nthe discoveries at Cyprus give him warrant for doing, in painting their\r\nrobes in the deepest and most lustrous hues, and in being almost too\r\nlavish in his manner of adorning their arms and breasts. Every figure\r\nof his is a glittering idol, enveloped in a dress of gold brocade\r\nembroidered with precious stones. His love of ornamentation is even\r\nextended to his landscapes. They are improbable, far too fair, far too\r\nrich, far too strange to exist in the actual world, but they are in\r\nclose harmony with the character of these sumptuously clad figures which\r\nwander in them like the mystic and melancholy shapes of a dream. The\r\ncapricious generation that lived in the Renaissance occasionally handled\r\nclassical subjects in this manner, but there is the same difference\r\nbetween Filippino Lippi and Gustave Moreau as there is between\r\nBotticelli and Burne-Jones: the former, like Shakespeare in the\r\n_Midsummer Night\'s Dream_, transformed the antique into a blithe and\r\nfantastic fairy world, whereas that fire of yearning romance which once\r\nflamed from poor H\xc3\xb6lderlin\'s poet heart burns in the pictures of Moreau.\r\n\r\nHis "Orpheus" is one of his most characteristic and beautiful works. He\r\nhas not borrowed the composition from antique tragedy. The drama is\r\nover. Orpheus has been torn asunder by the M\xc3\xa6nads, and the limbs of the\r\npoet lie scattered over the icy fields of the hyperborean lands. His\r\nhead, borne upon his lyre now for ever mute, has been cast upon the\r\nshore of Erebus. Nature seems to sleep in mysterious peace. Around there\r\nis nothing to be seen but still waters and pallid light, nothing to be\r\nheard but the tone of a small shrill flute, played by a barbarian\r\nshepherd sitting on the cliff. A Thracian girl, whose hair is adorned\r\nwith a garland, and whose look is earnest, has taken up the head of the\r\nsinger and regards it long and quietly. Is it merely pity that is in her\r\neyes? A romantic Hellenism, a profound melancholy underlies the picture,\r\nand the old story closes with a cry of love. In his "Oedipus and the\r\nSphinx" of 1864, and his "Heracles" of 1878, he treated battle scenes,\r\nthe heroic struggle between man and beast, and in these pictures, also,\r\nthere is no violence, no vehemence, no movement. In a terrible silence\r\nthe two antagonists exchange looks in his "Oedipus and the Sphinx,"\r\nwhile their breath mingles. Like a living riddle, the winged creature\r\ngazes upon the stranger, but the youth with his long locks stands so\r\ncomposedly before her that the spectator feels that he must know the\r\ndecisive word.\r\n\r\nIn "Helen upon the Walls of Troy" the figure of the enchantress, as she\r\nstands there motionless, clad in a robe glittering with brilliant stones\r\nand diamonds like a shrine, is seen to rise against the blood-red\r\nhorizon as though it were a statue of gold and ivory. Like a queen of\r\nspades, she holds in her hand a large flower. Heaps of bodies pierced\r\nwith arrows lie at her feet. But she has no glance of pity for the dying\r\nwhose death-rattle greets her. Her wide, apathetic eyes are fixed upon\r\nvacancy. She sees in the gold of the sunset the smoke ascending from the\r\nGrecian camp. She will embark in the fair ship of Menelaus, and return\r\nin triumph to Hellas, where new love shall be her portion. And the looks\r\nof the old men fasten upon her in admiration. "It is fitting that the\r\nTrojans and the Ach\xc3\xa6ans fight for such a woman." Helen in her blond\r\nvoluptuous beauty is transformed beneath the hands of Moreau into\r\nDestiny stalking over ground saturated with blood, into the Divinity of\r\nMischief--a divinity that, without knowing it, poisons everything that\r\ncomes near her, or that she sees or touches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  MOREAU.   THE YOUNG MAN AND DEATH.]\r\n\r\nIn his "Galatea" Moreau\'s love of jewels and enamel finds its highest\r\ntriumph. Galatea\'s grotto is one large, glittering casket. Flowers made\r\nfrom the sun, and leaves from the stars, and branches of coral stretch\r\nforth their boughs and open their cups. And as the most brilliant jewel\r\nof all, there rests in the holy of holies the radiant form of the\r\nsleeping Galatea, a kind of Greek Susanna, watched by the staring,\r\nadamantine eye of Polyphemus.\r\n\r\nAnd just as he bathes these Grecian forms in the dusk of a profound\r\nromantic melancholy, so in Moreau\'s pictures the figures of the Bible\r\nare tinged with a shade of Indian Buddhism, a pantheistic mysticism\r\nwhich places them in a strange modern light. In his "David" he\r\nrepresents in a quiet and peaceful way the entry of a human soul into\r\nNirvana. The aged king sits dreaming upon his gorgeous throne, and an\r\nangel watches in shining beauty beside this phantom, the flame of whose\r\nlife is slowly sinking. A curious light falls upon him from the sky. The\r\nlight of the evening horizon shines faint between the pillars, and the\r\nspectator feels that it is the end of a long day. His pictures of 1878\r\ndealing with Salome, in their strange sentiment--suggestive of an opium\r\nvision--are like a paraphrase of Heine\'s poem in _Atta Troll_. In a\r\nsombre hall supported by mighty pillars, through which coloured lamps\r\nand stupefying pastil-burners shed a blue and red light, sits Herod the\r\nking, half asleep with hasheesh, wrapped in silk, and motionless as a\r\nHindu idol. His face is pale and gloomy, and his throne is like a\r\ncrystal confessional chair, fashioned with all the riches of the world.\r\nTwo women lean at the foot of a pillar. One of them touches the strings\r\nof a lute, and a small panther yawns near a vessel of incense. Upon the\r\nfloor of variegated mosaics flowers lie strewn. Salome advances.\r\nTripping upon her toes as lightly as a figure in a dream, she begins to\r\ndance, holding a tremulous lotus-flower in her hand. A shining tiara is\r\nupon her head; her body is adorned with all the jewels which the dragons\r\nguard in the veins of the earth. Faster and faster and with a more\r\nvoluptuous grace she twists and stretches her splendid limbs; but of a\r\nsudden she starts and presses her hand to her heart: she has seen the\r\nexecutioner as he smote the head of John from the body.--In the midst of\r\nan Oriental paradise, the body of the Baptist lies in the grass; the\r\nhead has been set upon a charger, and Salome, like a bloodthirsty\r\ntigress, watches it with looks of ardent, famished love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  MOREAU.   ORPHEUS.]\r\n\r\nDifferent as they seem in technique, there are many points of contact\r\nbetween the visionary Gustave Moreau and _Puvis de Chavannes_, the\r\noriginal and fascinating creator of the decorative painting of the\r\nnineteenth century. Where one indulges in detail, the other resorts to\r\nsimplification; where the former is opulent the latter is ascetic; and\r\nyet they are associated through inward sympathy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  MOREAU.   DESIGN FOR ENAMEL.]\r\n\r\nPuvis de Chavannes is the Domenico Ghirlandajo of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. The most eminent mural works which have been achieved in France\r\nowe their existence to him. Wall-paintings from his hand may be found\r\nabove the staircase of the museums of Amiens, Marseilles, and Lyons, in\r\nthe Paris Panth\xc3\xa9on and the new Sorbonne, in the town-halls of Poitiers\r\nand many other French towns--pictures which it is difficult to describe\r\nin detail, through the medium of pedestrian prose. The two works with\r\nwhich he opened the decorative series in the museum of Amiens in 1861\r\nare entitled "Bellum" and "Concordia." In the former warriors are riding\r\nover a monotonous plain. Two smoking pillars, the gloomy witnesses to\r\nsorrow and devastation, cast their dark shadows over the still fields,\r\nwhilst here and there burning mills rise into the sombre sky like\r\ntorches. In "Concordia," the counterpart to this work, there are women\r\nplucking flowers, and naked youths urging on their horses amid a\r\nluxuriant grove of laurel. In the Paris Panth\xc3\xa9on he painted, between\r\n1876 and 1878, "The Girlhood of St. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve." A laughing spring\r\nlandscape, filled with the blitheness of May, spreads beneath the bright\r\nsky of the Isle de France. Calm figures move in it, men and women,\r\nchildren and greybeards. A bishop lays his hand upon the head of a young\r\nshepherdess; sailors are coming ashore from their barks. "The Grove\r\nsacred to the Arts and Muses" comes first in the decoration of the Lyons\r\nMuseum. Upon one side is a thick forest, dark and profound, and upon the\r\nother the horizon is fringed by violet-blue hills and a large lake\r\nreflecting the bluish atmosphere; in the foreground are green meadows,\r\nwhere the flowers gleam like stars, and trees standing apart, oaks and\r\nfirs, their strong, straight stems rising stiffly into the sky. At the\r\nfoot of a pillared porch strange figures lie by the shore or stand erect\r\namid the pale grass, one with her arm pointing upwards, another musing\r\nwith her hand resting upon her chin, a third unrolling a parchment.\r\nAthletic youths are bringing flowers and winding garlands. The "Vision\r\nof Antiquity" and "Christian Inspiration" complete the series. The\r\nformer of these pictures brings the spectator into Attica. Locked by a\r\nsimple landscape of hills the blue sea is rippling, and bright islands\r\nrise from its bosom, while a clear sky sheds its full light from above.\r\nTrees and shrubs are growing here and there. A shepherd is playing upon\r\nthe pan-pipes, goats are grazing, and five female figures, some of them\r\nnude, the others clothed, caress tame peacocks in the tall grass or lean\r\nagainst a parapet, breathing in the fresh, cool air. Farther back, at\r\nthe foot of a height, is a young woman, holding herself erect like a\r\nstatue, as she talks with a youth, whilst in the distance at the verge\r\nof the sea a spectral cavalcade, like that in Phidias\' frieze of the\r\nParthenon, gallops swiftly by. In the counterpart, "Christian\r\nInspiration," a number of friars who are devoted to art are gathered\r\ntogether in the portico of an abbey church. The walls are embellished\r\nwith na\xc3\xafve frescoes in the style of the Siennese school. One of the\r\nmonks who is working on the pictures has alighted from the ladder and\r\nregards the result of his toil with a critical air. Lilies are blooming\r\nin a vase upon the ground. Outside, beyond the cloister wall, the flush\r\nof evening sheds its parting light over a lonely landscape, whence dark\r\ncypresses rise into the air, straight as a lance. In the decoration of\r\nthe Sorbonne the object was to suggest all the lofty purposes to which\r\nthe place has been dedicated upon the wall of the great amphitheatre\r\nused for the solemn sessions of the faculty, and facing the statues of\r\nthe founders. Puvis de Chavannes did this by displaying a throne in a\r\nsacred grove, a throne upon which a grave matron arrayed in sombre\r\ngarments is sitting in meditation. This is the old Sorbonne. Two genii\r\nat her side bring palm-branches and crowns as offerings in honour of the\r\nfamous minds of the past. Around are standing manifold figures arrayed\r\nin the costumes which were assigned to the arts and sciences in Florence\r\nat the time of Botticelli and Filippino Lippi. From the rock upon which\r\nthey are set there bursts the living spring from which youth derives\r\nknowledge and new power. A thick wood divides this quiet haunt,\r\nconsecrated to the Muses, from the rush and the petty trifles of life.\r\nIn a painting entitled "Inter Artes et Naturam," over the staircase of\r\nthe museum of Rouen, artists musing over the ruins of medi\xc3\xa6val buildings\r\nare seen lying in the midst of a Norman landscape, beneath apple-trees\r\nwhose branches are weighed down by their burden of fruit; upon the other\r\nside of the picture there is a woman holding a child upon her knees,\r\nwhilst another woman is trying to reach a bough laden with fruit, and a\r\ngroup of painters look on enchanted with the grace of her simple,\r\nharmonious movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  MOREAU.   THE PLAINT OF THE POET.]\r\n\r\nPuvis de Chavannes is not a virtuoso in technique; for a Frenchman,\r\nindeed, he is almost clumsy, and is sure in very little of the work of\r\nhis hand,--in fact, it is quite possible that a later age will not\r\nreckon him among the great painters. But what it can never forget is\r\nthat after a period of lengthy aberrations he restored decorative art\r\nin general to its proper vocation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  MOREAU.   THE APPARITION.]\r\n\r\nBefore his time what was good in the so-called monumental painting of\r\nthe nineteenth century was usually not new, but borrowed from more\r\nfortunate ages, and what was new in it, the narrative element, was not\r\ngood, or at least not in good taste. When Paolo Veronese produced his\r\npictures in the Doge\'s Palace or Giulio Romano his frescoes in the Sala\r\ndei Giganti in Mantua, neither of them thought of the great mission of\r\ninstructing the people or of patriotic sentiments; they wanted to\r\nachieve an effect which should be pictorial, festal, and harmonious in\r\nfeeling. The task of painters who were entrusted with the embellishment\r\nof the walls of a building was to waken dreams and strike chords of\r\nfeeling, to summon a mood of solemnity, to delight the eye, to uplift\r\nthe spirit. What they created was decorative music, filling the mansion\r\nwith its august sound as the solemn notes of an organ roll through a\r\nchurch. Their pictures stood in need of no commentary, no exertion of\r\nthe mind, no historical learning. But the painting which in the\r\nnineteenth century did duty upon official occasions and was encouraged\r\nby governments for the sake of its pedagogical efficiency was not\r\npermitted to content itself with this general range of sentiment; it had\r\nto lay on the colours more thickly, and to appeal to the understanding\r\nrather than to sentiment. Descriptive prose took the place of lyricism.\r\n\r\nPuvis de Chavannes went back to the true principle of the old painters\r\nby renouncing any kind of didactic intention in his art. In the Panth\xc3\xa9on\r\nof Paris, when the eye turns to the works of Puvis de Chavannes after\r\nbeholding all the admirable panels with which the recognised masters of\r\nthe flowing line have illustrated the temple of St. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, when it\r\nturns from St. Louis, Clovis, Jeanne d\'Arc, and Dionysius Sanctus to\r\n"The Girlhood of St. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve," it is as if one laid aside a prosy\r\nhistory of the world to read the _Eclogues_ of Virgil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Graphische K\xc3\xbcnste._   PIERRE PUVIS DE CHAVANNES.]\r\n\r\nIn the one case there are arch\xc3\xa6ological lectures, stage scenery, and\r\nhistrionic art; in the other, simple poetry and lyrical magic, a\r\nmarvellous evocation from the distant past of that atmosphere of legend\r\nwhich banishes the commonplace. His art would express nothing, would\r\nrepresent nothing; it would only charm and attune the spirit, like music\r\nheard faintly from the distance. His figures perform no significant\r\nactions; nor are any learned attributes employed in their\r\ncharacterisation, such as were introduced in Greece and at the\r\nRenaissance. He does not paint Mars, Vulcan, and Minerva, but war, work,\r\nand peace. In translating the word _bellum_ into the language of\r\npainting in the Museum of Amiens he did not need academical Bellonas,\r\nnor sword-cuts, nor knightly suits of armour, nor fluttering standards.\r\nA group of mourning and stricken women, warlike horsemen, and a simple\r\nlandscape sufficed him to conjure up the drama of war in all its\r\nterrible majesty. And he is as far from gross material heaviness as from\r\nacademical sterility. The reapers toiling in his painting entitled\r\n"Summer" are modern in their movements and in their whole appearance,\r\nand yet they belong to no special time and seem to have been wafted into\r\na world beyond; they are beings who might have lived yesterday, or, for\r\nthe matter of that, a thousand years ago. The whole of existence seems\r\nin Puvis de Chavannes like a day without beginning or end, a day of\r\nParadise, unchangeable and eternal. And very simple means sufficed him\r\nto attain this transcendental effect: like Millet, he generalises what\r\nis individual, and tempers what is presented in nature; antique nudity\r\nis associated in an unforced manner with modern costume; a designed\r\nsimplicity, which has nothing of the academical painting of the nude,\r\nis expressed in the handling of form. Even his landscape he constructs\r\nupon its elementary forms, and by means of its essential, expressive\r\nfeatures. But by a certain concordance of lines, by a distinct rhythm of\r\nform, he compasses a sentiment which is grave and solemn or idyllic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUVIS DE CHAVANNES.   A VISION OF ANTIQUITY.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nThe Quattrocentisti, especially Ghirlandajo, were his models in this\r\nepical simplicity, and beside Baudry, the deft and spirited decorator of\r\nthe most modernised High Renaissance style, he has the effect of a\r\nprimitive artist risen from the grave. His pictures have an archaic\r\nbloom--something sacerdotal, if you will, something seraphic and holy.\r\nOften one fancies that one recognises the influence of old tapestries,\r\nto say nothing of Fra Angelico, but one is at a loss to give the model\r\ncopied. And what places him like Moreau in sharp opposition to the old\r\nmasters is that, instead of their sunny, smiling blitheness, he too is\r\nunder the sway of that heavy melancholy spirit which the close of the\r\nnineteenth century first brought into the world.\r\n\r\nWhen he, a countryman of Flandrin and Chenavard, began his career under\r\nCouture over half a century ago, the world did not understand his\r\npictures. People blamed the poverty of his palette, asserted that he was\r\ntoo simple and restricted in his methods of colouring, and he was called\r\na Lenten painter, _un peintre de car\xc3\xaame_, whose dull eye noted nothing\r\nin nature except ungainly lines and uniformly grey tones. Women were\r\nespecially unfavourable to him, taking his lean figures as a personal\r\ninsult to themselves. Moreover, the calm and immobility of his figures\r\nwere censured, and when he exhibited his earliest pictures in 1854, at\r\nthe same time as those of Courbet, he was called _un fou tranquille_,\r\njust as the latter was christened _un fou furieux_. In later years it\r\nwas precisely through these two qualities, his grandiose quietude and\r\nhis "an\xc3\xa6mic" painting, that he brought the world beneath his spell, and\r\ndiverted French art into a new course.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  PUVIS DE CHAVANNES.   THE BEHEADING OF JOHN THE BAPTIST.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nAs his landscapes know nothing of agitated clouds, nor abruptness nor\r\nthe strife of the elements, so his figures avoid all oratorical\r\nvehemence. They are eternally young, free from brutal passions, lost in\r\noblivion. Let him conjure up old Hellas or the quiet life of the\r\ncloister, over figures and landscapes there always rests a tender\r\nsentiment of consecration and dreamy peace; no violent gesture and no\r\nloud tone disturb that harmony of feeling by any vehement action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUVIS DE CHAVANNES.   THE THREADSPINNER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Neurdein fr\xc3\xa8res, photo._\r\n\r\n  PUVIS DE CHAVANNES.   THE POOR FISHERMAN.]\r\n\r\nNor does the colour admit any discord in the large harmony. It is\r\nexceedingly soft and light, although subdued; it has that faint,\r\ndeadened indecisiveness to be seen in faded tapestries or vanishing\r\nfrescoes. Tender and delicate in its chalky grey unity, which banishes\r\nreality and creates a world of dreams, it is spread around the shadowy\r\nfigures. It is impossible to imagine his pictures without this light so\r\npure and yet veiled, this silvery, transparent air, impregnated with the\r\nbreath of the Divine, as Plato would say; it is impossible to imagine\r\nthem without the delicate tones of these pale green, pale rose-coloured,\r\nand pale violet dresses, which are as delicate as fading flowers, and\r\nwithout this flesh-tint, which lends a phantomlike and unearthly\r\nappearance to his figures. It is all like a melody pitched in the high,\r\nfinely touched, and tremulous tones of a violin; it invites a mood which\r\nis at once blithe and sentimental, happy and sad, banishes all earthly\r\nthings into oblivion, and carries one into a distant, peaceful, and holy\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n  "Mon coeur est en repos, mon \xc3\xa2me est en silence,\r\n   Le bruit lointain du monde expire en arrivant,\r\n   Comme un son \xc3\xa9loign\xc3\xa9 qu\'affaiblit la distance,\r\n   \xc3\x80 l\'oreille incertaine apport\xc3\xa9 par le vent.\r\n\r\n   J\'ai trop vu, trop senti, trop aim\xc3\xa9 dans ma vie;\r\n   Je viens chercher vivant le calme du L\xc3\xa9th\xc3\xa9:\r\n   Beaux lieux, soyez pour moi ces bords o\xc3\xb9 l\'on oublie;\r\n   L\'oubli seul d\xc3\xa9sormais est ma f\xc3\xa9licit\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n   D\'ici je vois la vie, \xc3\xa0 travers un nuage,\r\n   S\'\xc3\xa9vanouir pour moi dans l\'ombre du pass\xc3\xa9...\r\n\r\n   L\'amiti\xc3\xa9 me trahit, la piti\xc3\xa9 m\'abandonne,\r\n   Et, seul, je descends le sentier de tombeaux.\r\n\r\n   Mais la nature est l\xc3\xa0 qui t\'invite et qui t\'aime;\r\n   Plonge-toi dans son sein qu\'elle t\'ouvre toujours;\r\n   Quand tout change pour toi, la nature est la m\xc3\xaame,\r\n   Est le m\xc3\xaame soleil se l\xc3\xa8ve sur tes jours."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Levy et ses Fils, photo._\r\n\r\n  PUVIS DE CHAVANNES.   SUMMER.]\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the doctrine of the two souls in _Faust_ was\r\nexemplified in Germany also: from the fertile manure of Naturalism there\r\nsprang the blue flower of a new Romanticism. In Germany there had once\r\nlived Albrecht D\xc3\xbcrer, the greatest and most profound painter-poet of all\r\ntime; and there, too, even in an unpropitious age that genial visionary\r\nMoritz Schwind succeeded in flourishing. When the period of eclectic\r\nimitation had been overcome by Naturalism, was it not fitting that\r\nartists should once more attempt to embody the world of dreams beside\r\nthat of actual existence, and beside tangible reality to give shape to\r\nthe unearthly foreboding which fills the human heart with the visions\r\nand the cravings of fancy? In that age of hope arose the cult of\r\n_Boecklin_, and Germany began to honour in him who had been so long\r\nblasphemed the founder of a new and ardently desired art.\r\n\r\nBurne-Jones, Puvis de Chavannes, Gustave Moreau, and Arnold Boecklin\r\nmake up the four-leaved clover of modern Idealism. To future generations\r\nthey will bear witness to the sentiment of Europe at the close of the\r\nnineteenth century. All four are more or less of the same age; they all\r\nfour began their work in the beginning of the fifties; and they were all\r\ndifferent from their contemporaries and from those who had gone before\r\nthem. They embodied the spirit of the future. Boecklin had gone through\r\na process of change as little as the others. His spirit was so rich that\r\nit comprised a century in itself, and leads us now towards the century\r\nto come. He was the contemporary of Schwind, he is our own contemporary,\r\nand he will be the contemporary of those who come after us. And it were\r\nas impossible to derive his art from that of any previous movement as to\r\nexplain how he, our greatest visionary, came to be born in Basle, the\r\nmost prosaic town in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Levy et ses Fils, photo._\r\n\r\n  PUVIS DE CHAVANNES.   AUTUMN.]\r\n\r\nHis father was a merchant there, and he was born in the year 1827. In\r\n1846 he went to Schirmer in D\xc3\xbcsseldorf, and upon Schirmer\'s advice\r\nrepaired to Brussels, where he copied the old Dutch masters in the\r\ngallery. By the sale of some of his works he acquired the means of\r\ntravelling to Paris. He passed through the days of the Revolution of\r\nJune in 1848, studied the pictures in the Louvre, and returned home\r\nafter a brief stay to perform his military duties. In the March of 1850,\r\nwhen he was three-and-twenty, he went to Rome, where he entered the\r\ncircle of Anselm Feuerbach; and in 1853 he married a Roman lady. In the\r\nfollowing year he produced the decorative pictures in which he\r\nrepresented the relations of man to fire; these had been ordered for the\r\nhouse of a certain Consul Wedekind in Hanover, but were sent back as\r\nbeing "bizarre." In 1856 he betook himself--rather hard up for money--to\r\nMunich, where he exhibited in the Art Union "The Great Pan," which was\r\nbought by the Pinakothek. Paul Heyse was the medium of his making the\r\nacquaintance of Schack. And in 1858 he was appointed a teacher at the\r\nAcademy of Weimar, by the influence of Lenbach and Begas. During this\r\ntime he produced "Pan startling a Goat-herd" in the Schack Gallery, and\r\n"Diana Hunting." After three years he was again in Rome, and painted\r\nthere "The Old Roman Tavern," "The Shepherd\'s Plaint of Love," and "The\r\nVilla by the Sea." In 1866 he went to Basle to complete the frescoes\r\nover the staircase of the museum, and in 1871 he was in Munich, where\r\n"The Idyll of the Sea" was exhibited amongst other things. In 1876 he\r\nsettled in Florence, in 1886 at Z\xc3\xbcrich. From 1895 until the day of his\r\ndeath, January 16, 1901, he lived like a patriarch of art in his country\r\nhouse on the ridge of Fiesole.\r\n\r\nAny one who would interpret a theory based upon the idea that an artist\r\nis the result of influences might, while he is about it, speak of\r\nBoecklin\'s apprentice period in D\xc3\xbcsseldorf and Schirmer\'s biblical\r\nlandscapes. That "harmonious blending of figures with landscape," which\r\nis the leading note in Boecklin\'s work, was of course from the days of\r\nClaude Lorraine and Poussin the essence of the so-called historical\r\nlandscape which found its principal representatives at a later period in\r\nKoch, Preller, Rottmann, Lessing, and Schirmer. Yet Boecklin is not the\r\ndisciple of these masters, but stands at the very opposite pole of art.\r\nThe art of all these men was merely a species of historical painting.\r\nOld Koch read the Bible, \xc3\x86schylus, Ossian, Dante, and Shakespeare; found\r\nin them such scenes as Noah\'s thank-offering, Macbeth and the witches,\r\nor Fingal\'s battle with the spirit of Loda; and sought amid the Sabine\r\nhills, in Olevano and Subiaco, for sites where these incidents might\r\nhave taken place. Preller made the _Odyssey_ the basis of his artistic\r\ncreation, chose out of it moments where the scene might be laid in some\r\nlandscape, and found in R\xc3\xbcgen, Norway, Sorrento, and the coast of Capri\r\nthe elements of nature necessary to his epic. Rottmann worked upon\r\nhexameters composed by King Ludwig, and adhered in the views he painted\r\nto the historical memories attached to the towns of Italy. Lessing\r\nsought inspiration in Sir Walter Scott, for whose monks and nuns he\r\ndevised an appropriately sombre and mysterious background. Schirmer\r\nillustrated the Books of Moses by placing the figures in Schnorr\'s\r\nPicture Bible in Preller\'s Odyssean landscape. Whether they were\r\nClassicists appealing to the eye by the architecture of form, or\r\nRomanticists addressing the spirit by the "mood" in their landscapes, it\r\nwas common to all these painters that they set out from a literary or\r\nhistorical subject. They gave an exact interpretation of the actions\r\nprescribed by their authors, surrounding the figures with fictitious\r\nlandscapes, corresponding in general conception to one\'s notion of the\r\nsurroundings of heroes, patriarchs, or hermits. Their pictures are\r\nhistorical incidents with a stage-setting of landscape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  ARNOLD BOECKLIN.   PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF.]\r\n\r\nIn Boecklin all this is reversed. Landscape painter he is in his very\r\nessence, and he is, moreover, the greatest landscape painter of the\r\nnineteenth century, at whose side even the Fontainebleau group seem\r\none-sided specialists. Every one of the latter had a peculiar type of\r\nlandscape, and a special hour in the day which appealed to his feelings\r\nmore distinctly than any other. One loved spring and dewy morning,\r\nanother the clear, cold day, another the threatening majesty of the\r\nstorm, the flashing effects of sportive sunbeams, or the evening after\r\nsunset, when colours fade from view. But Boecklin is as inexhaustible as\r\ninfinite nature herself. In one place he celebrates the festival of\r\nspring with its burden of beauty: it is ushered in by snowdrops, and\r\ngreeted with joy by the veined cups of the crocus; yellow primroses and\r\nblue violets merrily nod their heads, and a hundred tiny mountain\r\nstreams leap precipitately into the valley to announce the coming of\r\nspring. In another, nature shines and blooms and chimes, and breathes\r\nher balm in all the colours of summer. Tulips freaked with purple rise\r\nat the side of paths; flowers in rows of blue, white, and\r\nyellow--hyacinths, daisies, gentians, anemones, and snapdragon--fill the\r\nsward in hordes; and down in the valley blow the narcissus in dazzling\r\nmyriads, loading the air with an overpowering perfume. But, beside such\r\nlovely idylls, he has painted with puissant sublimity as many\r\ncomplaining elegies and tempestuous tragedies. Here, the sombre autumnal\r\nlandscapes, with their tall black cypresses, are lashed by the rain and\r\nthe howling storm. There, lonely islands or grave, half-ruined towers,\r\ntangled with creepers, rise dreamily from a lake, mournfully hearkening\r\nto the repining murmur of the waves; and there, in the midst of a narrow\r\nrocky glen, a rotten bridge hangs over a fearful abyss. Or a raging\r\nstorm, beneath the might of which the forests bow, blusters round a wild\r\nmountain land which rises from a blue-black lake. Boecklin has painted\r\neverything: the graceful and heroic, the solitude and the waste, the\r\nsolemnly sublime and the darkly tragic, passionate agitation and\r\ndemoniacal fancy, the strife of foaming waves and the eternal rest of\r\nrigid masses of rock, the wild uproar of the sky and the still peace of\r\nflowery fields. The compass of his moods is as much greater than that of\r\nthe French Classicists as Italy is greater than Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nFor Italy is Boecklin\'s home as a landscape painter, and the moods of\r\nnature there are more in number than Poussin ever painted. Grave and sad\r\nand grandiose is the Roman Campagna, with the ruins of the street of\r\nsepulchres, and the grey and black herds of cattle looking mournfully\r\nover the brown pastures. Hidden like the Sleeping Beauty lie the Roman\r\nvillas in his pictures, in their sad combination of splendour and decay,\r\nof life and death, of youth and age. Behind weather-beaten grotto-wells\r\nand dark green nooks of yew, white busts and statues gleam like\r\nphantoms. From lofty terraces the water in decaying aqueducts trickles\r\ndown with a monotonous murmur into still pools, where bracken and\r\nwithered shrubs overgrown with ivy are reflected. Huge cypresses of the\r\ngrowth of centuries stand gravely in the air, tossing their heads\r\nmournfully when the wind blows. Then at a bound we are at Tivoli, and\r\nthe whole scenery is changed. Great fantastic rocks rise straight into\r\nthe air, luxuriantly mantled by ivy and parasitic growths; trees and\r\nshrubs take root in the clefts; the floods of the Anio plunge\r\nheadforemost into the depths with a roar of sound, like a legion of\r\ndemons thunder-stricken by some higher power. Then comes Naples, with\r\nits glory of flowers and its moods of evening glowing in deep ruby. Blue\r\ncreepers twine round the balustrades of castles; hedges of monthly roses\r\nveil the roads, and oranges grow large amid the dark foliage. Farther\r\naway he paints the Homeric world of Sicily, with its crags caressed or\r\nstorm-beaten by the wave, its blue grottoes, and its deep glowing\r\nsplendours of changing colour. Or he represents the inland landscape of\r\nFlorence with its soft graceful lines of hill, its fields and flowers,\r\nbuds and blossoms, and its numbers of white dreaming villas hidden amid\r\nrosy oleanders and standing against the blue sky with a brightness\r\nalmost dazzling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Seemann, Leipzig._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   A VILLA BY THE SEA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Munich._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   A ROCKY CHASM.]\r\n\r\nBoecklin has no more rendered an exact portrait of the scenery of Italy\r\nthan the Classic masters of France sought to represent in a photographic\r\nway districts in the forest of Fontainebleau. His whole life, like\r\ntheirs, was a renewed and perpetual wooing of nature. As a boy he looked\r\ndown from his attic in Basle upon the heaving waters of the Rhine. When\r\nhe was in Rome, in 1850, he wandered daily in the Campagna to feast his\r\neyes upon its grave lines and colours. After a few years in Weimar he\r\ngave up his post to gather fresh impressions in Italy. And the moods\r\nwith which he was inspired by nature and the phenomena he observed were\r\nstored in his mind as though in a great emporium. Then his imagination\r\nwent through another stage. That "organic union of figures and\r\nlandscape" which the representatives of "heroic landscape" had surmised\r\nand endeavoured to attain by a reasoned method through the illustration\r\nof passages in poetry took place in Boecklin by the force of intuitive\r\nconception. The mood excited in him by a landscape is translated into an\r\nintuition of life.\r\n\r\nIn many pictures, particularly those of his earlier period, the\r\nground-tone given by the landscape finds merely a faint echo in small\r\naccessory figures. In such pictures he stands more or less on a level\r\nwith _Dreber_, that master who died in Rome in 1875, and was forgotten\r\nin the history of German art more swiftly than ought to have been the\r\ncase. Franz Dreber was not one of those Classicists dispersed over the\r\nface of Europe, men who were content with setting heroic actions in the\r\nmidst of noble landscapes in the fashion of Preller; on the contrary, he\r\nwas the lyricist of this movement, the first man who did not touch the\r\nepical material of old myths in a manner that was merely scholarly and\r\nillustrative, but developed his picture from the original note of\r\nlandscape. In his pictures nature laughs with those who are glad, mourns\r\nwith those who weep, sheds her light upon the joyful, and envelops\r\ntortured spirits in storm and the terror of thunder. If the golden age\r\nis to be represented, the scene is a soft summer landscape, where\r\neverything breathes peace and innocence and bliss. And the life of those\r\nwho inhabit this happy region runs by in blissful peace also. Fair women\r\nand children rest upon the meadow, and gather fruits and pluck roses. If\r\nhe paints Ulysses upon the shore of the sea, looking with yearning\r\ntowards his distant home, a dull, sultry haze of noon broods over the\r\ndistrict, wide and grey like the hero\'s yearning. A spring landscape of\r\nsunny blitheness, with butterflies sipping at the blossoms of the trees\r\nand sunbeams sportively dallying on the sea, are the surroundings of the\r\npicture where Psyche is crowned by Eros. And if Prometheus is\r\nrepresented chained to the rock and striving to burst his fetters, all\r\nnature fights the fight of the Titan. Lurid clouds move swiftly through\r\nthe sky, ghostly flashes of lightning quiver, and a wild tempest rakes\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Munich._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   THE PENITENT.]\r\n\r\nIn Boecklin\'s earlier pictures the accessory figures are placed in close\r\nrelation with the landscape in a manner entirely similar. The mysterious\r\nkeynote of sentiment in nature gives the theme of the scene represented.\r\nIn the picture called "The Penitent," in the Schack Gallery, a hermit is\r\nkneeling half-naked before the cross of the Saviour upon the slope of a\r\nsteep mountain. Troops of ravens fly screaming above his head, and a\r\nstrip of blue sky shines with an unearthly aspect between the trees,\r\nwhich are bent into wild shapes. The character of the scene is terribly\r\nsevere, and severe and heavy is the misery in the heart of the man\r\nchastising himself with the scourge in his hand as he kneels there in\r\nprayer. A deep melancholy rests over the picture named "The Villa by the\r\nSea." The failing waves break gently on the shore with a mournful\r\nwhisper, the wind utters its complaint blowing through the cypresses,\r\nand a few sunbeams wander coyly over the deep grey of the sky. At the\r\nsocle of a niche a young woman dressed in black stands, and, with her\r\nhead resting upon her hand, looks out of deeply veiled eyes over the\r\nmoving tide. In "The Spring of Love" the landscape vibrates in lyrically\r\nsoft and flattering chords. The budding splendour of blossoms covers the\r\ntrees luxuriantly, and a rivulet ripples over the laughing grassy balk.\r\nA young man touches the strings of a lyre and sings; and, joining in his\r\nsong, a maiden stands beside him leaning against a bush laden with\r\nblossom. In "The Walk to Emmaus" the ground-tone is given by a grave\r\nevening landscape. The storm ruffles the tops of the great trees, and\r\nchases across the sky the heavy clouds, over which strange evening\r\nlights are flitting. All nature trembles in shivering apprehension.\r\n"Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent."\r\n\r\nBut Boecklin\'s great creations reach a higher level. Having begun by\r\nextending the lyrical mood of a landscape to his figures, he finally\r\nsucceeded in peopling nature with beings which seem the final\r\ncondensation of the life of nature itself, the tangible embodiment of\r\nthat spirit of nature whose cosmic action in the water, the earth, and\r\nthe air, he had glorified in one of his youthful works, the frescoes of\r\nthe Basle Museum. In such pictures he has no forerunners whatever in the\r\nmore recent history of art. His principle of creation rests, it might be\r\nsaid, upon the same overwhelming feeling for nature which brought forth\r\nthe figures of Greek myth. When the ancient Greek stood before a\r\nwaterfall he gave human form to what he saw. His eye beheld the outlines\r\nof beautiful nude women, nymphs of the spot, in the descending volume of\r\nthe cascade; its foam was their fluttering hair, and in the rippling of\r\nthe water and spattering froth he heard their bold splashing and their\r\nlaughter. The elemental sway of nature, the secret interweaving of her\r\nforces took shape in plastic forms--\r\n\r\n  "Alles wies den eingeweihten Blicken,\r\n   Alles eines Gottes Spur ...\r\n   Diese H\xc3\xb6hen f\xc3\xbcllten Oreaden,\r\n   Eine Dryas lebt in jedem Baum,\r\n   Aus dem Urnen lieblicher Najaden\r\n   Sprang der Str\xc3\xb6me Silberschaum.\r\n   Jener Lorbeer wand sich einst um Hilfe,\r\n   Tantals Tochter schweigt in diesem Stein,\r\n   Syrinx Klage t\xc3\xb6nt aus jenem Schilfe,\r\n   Philomelas Schmerz aus diesem Hain."\r\n\r\nThe beings which live in Boecklin\'s pictures owe their origin to a\r\nsimilar action of the spirit. He hears trees, rivers, mountains, and\r\nuniversal nature whisper as with human speech. Every flower, every bush,\r\nevery flame, the rocks, the waves, and the meadows, dead and without\r\nfeeling as they are to the ordinary eye, have to his mind a vivid\r\nexistence of their own; and in the same way the old poet conceived the\r\nlightning as a fiery bird and the clouds as the flocks of heaven. The\r\nstones have a voice, white walls lengthen like huge phantoms, the bright\r\nlights of the houses upon a mountain declivity at night change into the\r\ngreat eyes with which the spirit of the fell glares fixedly down;\r\nlegions of strange beings circle and whir round in the fantastic region.\r\nIn his imagination every impression of nature condenses itself into\r\nfigures that may be seen. As a dragon issues from his lair to terrify\r\ntravellers in the gloom of a mountain ravine, and as the avenging Furies\r\nrise in the waste before a murderer, so in the still brooding noon, when\r\na shrill tone is heard suddenly and without a cause, the Grecian Pan\r\nlives once again for Boecklin--Pan, who startles the goat-herd from his\r\ndream by an eerie shout, and then whinnies in mockery at the terrified\r\nfugitive. The cool, wayward splashing element of water takes shape as a\r\ngraceful nymph, shrouded in a transparent water-blue veil, leaning upon\r\nher welling urn as she listens dreamily to the song of a bird. The fine\r\nmists which rise from the fountain-head become embodied as a row of\r\nmerry children, whose vaporous figures float hazily through the shining\r\nclouds of spring. The secret voices that live amid the silence of the\r\nwood press round him, and the phantom born of the excited senses becomes\r\na ghostly unicorn advancing with noiseless step, and bearing upon his\r\nback a maiden of legendary story dressed in a white garment. In the\r\nthundercloud lying over the broad summit of a mountain and abundant in\r\nblessing rain he sees the huge body of the giant Prometheus, who brought\r\nfire from heaven and lies fettered to the mountain top, spreading over\r\nthe landscape like a cloud. The form of Death stumbling past cloven\r\ntrees in rain and tempest, as he rides his pale horse, appears to him in\r\na waste and chill autumnal region, where stands a ruined castle in lurid\r\nillumination. A sacred grove, lying in insular seclusion and fringed\r\nwith venerable old trees that rise straight into the air, rustling as\r\nthey bend their heads towards each other, is peopled, as at a word of\r\nenchantment, with grave priestly figures robed in white, which approach\r\nin solemn procession and fling themselves down in prayer before the\r\nsacrificial fire. The lonely waste of the sea is not brought home to him\r\nwith sufficient force by a wide floor of waves, with gulls indolently\r\nflying beneath a low and leaden sky; so he paints a flat crag emerging\r\nfrom the waves, and upon its crest, over which the billows sweep, the\r\nshy dwellers of the sea bathe in the light. Naiads and Tritons assembled\r\nfor a gamesome ride over the sea typify the sportive hide-and-seek of\r\nthe waves. Yet there is nothing forced, nothing merely ingenious,\r\nnothing literary in these inventions. The figures are not placed in\r\nnature with deliberate calculation: they are an embodied mood of nature;\r\nthey are children of the landscape, and no mere accessories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Munich._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   PAN STARTLING A GOAT-HERD.]\r\n\r\nBoecklin\'s power of creating types in embodying these beings of his\r\nimagination is a thing unheard of in the whole history of art. He has\r\nrepresented his Centaurs and Satyrs, and Fauns and Sirens and Cupids, so\r\nvividly and impressively that they have become ideas as currently\r\nacceptable as if they were simple incomposite beings. He has seen the\r\nawfulness of the sea at moments when the secret beings of the deep\r\nemerge, and he allows a glimpse into the fabulous reality of their\r\nheretofore unexplored existence. For all beings which hover swarming in\r\nthe atmosphere around have their dwelling in the trees or their haunts\r\nin rocky deserts, he has found new and convincing figures. Everything\r\nwhich was created in this field before his time--the works of D\xc3\xbcrer,\r\nMantegna, and Salvator Rosa not excepted--was an adroit sport with forms\r\nalready established by the Greeks, and a transposition of Greek statues\r\ninto a pictorial medium. With Boecklin, who instead of illustrating\r\nmythology himself creates it, a new power of inventing myths was\r\nintroduced. His creations are not the distant issue of nature, but\r\ncorporeal beings, full of ebullient energy, individualised through and\r\nthrough, and stout, lusty, and natural; and in creating them he has been\r\neven more consistent than the Greeks. In their work there is something\r\ninorganic in the combination of a horse\'s body with the head of Zeus or\r\nLaoco\xc3\xb6n grafted upon it. But in the presence of Boecklin\'s Centaurs\r\nheaving great boulders around them and biting and worrying each other\'s\r\nmanes, the spectator has really the feeling which prompts him to\r\nexclaim, "Every inch a steed!" In him the nature of the sea is expressed\r\nthrough his cold, slimy women with the dripping hair clinging to their\r\nheads far more powerfully than it was by the sea-gods of Greece. How\r\nmerciless is the look in their cold, black, soulless eyes! They are as\r\nterrible as the destroying sea that yesterday in its bellowing fury\r\nengulfed a hundred human creatures despairing in the anguish of death,\r\nand to-day stretches still and joyous in its blue infinity and its\r\ncallous oblivion of all the evils it has wrought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Munich._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   THE HERD.]\r\n\r\nAnd only a slight alteration in the truths of nature has sufficed him\r\nfor the creation of such chimerical beings. As a landscape painter he\r\nstands with all his fibres rooted in the earth, although he seems quite\r\nalienated from this world of ours, and his fabulous creatures make the\r\nsame convincing impression because they have been created with all the\r\ninner logical congruity of nature, and delineated under close\r\nrelationship to actual fact with the same numerous details as the real\r\nanimals of the earth. For his Tritons, Sirens, and Mermaids, with their\r\nawkward bodies covered with bristly hair and their prominent eyes, he\r\nmay have made studies from seals and walruses. As they stretch\r\nthemselves upon a rocky coast, fondling and playing with their young,\r\nthey have the look of sea-cows in human form, though, like men, they\r\nhave around them all manner of beasts of prey and domestic pets which\r\nthey caress,--in one place a sea-serpent, in another a seal. His obese\r\nand short-winded Tritons, with shining red faces and flaxen hair\r\ndripping with moisture, are good-humoured old gentlemen with a quantity\r\nof warm blood in their veins, who love and laugh and drink new wine. His\r\nFauns may be met with amongst the shepherds of the Campagna, swarthy\r\nstrapping fellows dressed in goat-skins after the fashion of Pan--lads\r\nwith glowing eyes and two rows of white teeth gleaming like ivory. It is\r\nchiefly the colour lavished upon them which turns them into children of\r\nan unearthly world, where other suns are shining and other stars.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of colour also the endeavours of Romanticists of the\r\nnineteenth century reach a climax in Boecklin. When Schwind and his\r\ncomrades set themselves to represent the romantic world of fairyland an\r\ninterdict was still laid upon colour, and it was lightly washed over the\r\ndrawing, which counted as the thing of prime importance. But Boecklin\r\nwas the first Romanticist in Germany to reveal the marvellous power in\r\ncolour for rendering moods of feeling and its inner depth of musical\r\nsentiment. Even in those years when the brown tone of the galleries\r\nprevailed everywhere, colour was allowed in his pictures to have its own\r\nindependent existence, apart from its office of being a merely\r\nsubordinate characteristic of form. For him green was thoroughly green,\r\nblue was divinely blue, and red was jubilantly red. At the very time\r\nwhen Richard Wagner lured the colours of sound from music, with a glow\r\nand light such as no master had kindled before, Boecklin\'s symphonies of\r\ncolour streamed forth like a crashing orchestra. The whole scale, from\r\nthe most sombre depth to the most chromatic light, was at his command.\r\nIn his pictures of spring the colour laughs, rejoices, and exults. In\r\n"The Isle of the Dead" it seems as though a veil of crape were spread\r\nover the sea, the sky, and the trees. And since that time Boecklin has\r\ngrown even greater. His splendid sea-green, his transparent blue sky,\r\nhis sunset flush tinged with violet haze, his yellow-brown rocks, his\r\ngleaming red sea-mosses, and the white bodies of his girls are always\r\narranged in new glowing, sensuous harmonies. Many of his pictures have\r\nsuch an ensnaring brilliancy that the eye is never weary of feasting\r\nupon their floating splendour.\r\n\r\nA master who died in Rome some nineteen years ago might have been in the\r\nprovince of mural painting for German art what Puvis de Chavannes has\r\nbecome for French. In the earlier histories of art his name is not\r\nmentioned. Seldom alluded to in life, dead as a German painter ten years\r\nbefore his death, he was summoned from the grave by the enthusiasm of a\r\nfriend who was a refined connoisseur four years after the earth had\r\nclosed over him. Such was _Hans von Mar\xc3\xa9es\'_ destiny as an artist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOECKLIN.   VENUS DESPATCHING CUPID.]\r\n\r\nMar\xc3\xa9es was born in Elberfeld in 1837. In beginning his studies he had\r\nfirst betaken himself to Berlin, and then went for eight years to\r\nMunich, where he paid his tribute to the historical tendency by a "Death\r\nof Schill." But in 1864 he migrated to Rome, where he secluded himself\r\nwith a few pupils, and passed his time in working and teaching. Only\r\nonce did he receive an order. He was entrusted in 1873 with the\r\nexecution of some mural paintings in the library of the Zoological\r\nMuseum in Naples, and lamented afterwards that he had not received the\r\ncommission in riper years. When he had sufficient confidence in himself\r\nto execute such tasks he had no similar opportunity, and thus he lost\r\nthe capacity for the rapid completion of a work. He began to doubt his\r\nown powers, sent no more pictures to any exhibition, and when he died in\r\nthe summer of 1887, at the age of fifty, his funeral was that of a man\r\nalmost unknown. It was only when his best works were brought together at\r\nthe annual exhibition of 1891 at Munich that he became known in wider\r\ncircles, and these pictures, now preserved in the Castle of\r\nSchleissheim, will show to future years who Hans von Mar\xc3\xa9es was, and\r\nwhat he aimed at.\r\n\r\n"An artist rarely confines himself to what he has the power of doing,"\r\nsaid Goethe once to Eckermann; "most artists want to do more than they\r\ncan, and are only too ready to go beyond the limits which nature has set\r\nto their talent." Setting out from this tenet, there would be little\r\ncause for rescuing Mar\xc3\xa9es from oblivion. Some portraits and a few\r\ndrawings are his only performances which satisfy the demands of the\r\nstudio--the portraits being large in conception and fine in taste, the\r\ndrawings sketched with a swifter and surer hand. His large works have\r\nneither in drawing nor colour any one of those advantages which are\r\nexpected in a good picture; they are sometimes incomplete, sometimes\r\ntortured, and sometimes positively childish. "He is ambitious, but he\r\nachieves nothing," was the verdict passed upon him in Rome. Upon\r\nprinciple Mar\xc3\xa9es was an opponent of all painting from the model. He\r\nscoffed at those who would only reproduce existing fact, and thus, in a\r\ncertain sense, reduplicate nature, according to Goethe\'s saying: "If I\r\npaint my mistress\'s pug true to nature, I have two pugs, but never a\r\nwork of art." For this reason he never used models for the purpose of\r\ndetailed pictorial studies; and just as little was he at pains to fix\r\nsituations in his mind by pencil sketches to serve as notes; for,\r\naccording to his view, the direct use of motives, as they are called, is\r\nonly a hindrance to free artistic creation. And, of course, creation of\r\nthis kind is only possible to a man who can always command a rich store\r\nof vivid memories of what he has seen and studied and profoundly grasped\r\nin earlier days. This treasury of artistic forms was not large enough in\r\nMar\xc3\xa9es. If one buries oneself in Mar\xc3\xa9es\' works--and there are some of\r\nthem in which the trace of great genius has altogether vanished beneath\r\nthe unsteady hand of a restless brooder--it seems as if there thrilled\r\nwithin them the cry of a human heart. Sometimes through his method of\r\npainting them over and over again he produced spectral beings with\r\ngrimacing faces. Their bodies have been so painted and repainted that\r\nwhole layers of colour lie upon separate parts, and ruin the impression\r\nin a ghastly fashion. Only too often his high purpose was wrecked by the\r\ninadequacy of his technical ability; and his poetic dream of beauty\r\nalmost always evaporated because his hand was too weak to give it shape.\r\n\r\nIf his pictures, in spite of all this, made a great effect in the Munich\r\nexhibition, it was because they formulated a principle. It was felt that\r\nnotes had been touched of which the echo would be long in dying. When\r\nMar\xc3\xa9es appeared there was no "grand painting" for painting\'s sake in\r\nGermany, but mural decoration after the fashion of the historical\r\npicture--works in which the aim of decorative art was completely\r\nmisunderstood, since they merely gave a rendering of arid and\r\ninstructive stories, where they should have simply aimed at expressing\r\n"a mood." Like his contemporary Puvis de Chavannes in France, Mar\xc3\xa9es\r\nrestored to this "grand painting" the principle of its life, its joyous\r\nimpulse, and did so not by painting anecdote, but because he aimed at\r\nnothing but pictorial decorative effect. A sumptuous festal impression\r\nmight be gained from his pictures; it was as though beautiful and\r\nsubdued music filled the air; they made the appeal of quiet hymns to the\r\nbeauty of nature, and were, at the same time, grave and monumental in\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIn one, St. Martin rides through a desolate wintry landscape upon a\r\nslow-trotting nag, and holds his outspread mantle towards the half-naked\r\nbeggar, shivering with the cold. In another, St. Hubert has alighted\r\nfrom his horse, and kneels in adoration before the cross which he sees\r\nbetween the antlers of the stag. In another, St. George, upon a powerful\r\nrearing horse, thrusts his lance through the body of the dragon with\r\nsolemn and earnest mien. But as a rule even the relationship with\r\nantique, mythological, and medi\xc3\xa6val legendary ideas is wanting in his\r\nart. Landscapes which seem to have been studied in another world he\r\npeoples with beings who pass their lives lost in contemplation of the\r\ndivine. Women and children, men and grey-beards live, and love, and\r\nlabour as though in an age that knows nothing of the stroke of the\r\nclock, and which might be yesterday or a hundred thousand years ago.\r\nThey repose upon the luxuriant sward shadowed by apple-trees laden with\r\nfruit, abandoning themselves to a thousand reveries and meditations.\r\nThey do not pose, and they aim at being nothing except children of\r\nnature, nature in her innocence and simplicity. Nude women stand\r\nmotionless under the trees, or youths are seen reflected in the pools.\r\nThe motive of gathering oranges is several times repeated: a youth\r\nsnatches at the fruit, an old man bends to pick up those which have\r\ndropped, and a child searches for those which have rolled away in the\r\ngrass. Sometimes the steed, the Homeric comrade of man, is introduced:\r\nthe nude youth rides his steed in the training-school, or the commander\r\nof an army gallops upon his splendid warhorse. Everything that Mar\xc3\xa9es\r\npainted belongs to the golden age. And when it was borne in mind that\r\nthese pictures had been produced twenty years back or more, they came to\r\nhave the significance of works that opened out a new path; there was\r\npoetry in the place of didactic formula; in the place of historical\r\nanecdote the joy of plastic beauty; in the place of theatrical vehemence\r\nan absence of gesticulation and a perfect simplicity of line. At a time\r\nwhen others rendered dramas and historical episodes by colours and\r\ngestures, Mar\xc3\xa9es composed idylls. He came as a man of great and austere\r\ntalent, Virgilian in his sense of infinite repose on the breast of\r\nnature, monastic in his abnegation of petty superficial allurements,\r\ndespite special attempts which he made at chromatic effect. Something\r\ndreamy and architectonic, lofty and yet familiar, intimate in feeling\r\nand yet monumental holds sway in his works. Intimacy of effect he\r\nachieved by the stress he laid upon landscape; monumental dignity by his\r\ngrandiose and earnest art, and his calm and sense of style in line. All\r\nabrupt turns and movements were avoided in his work. And he displayed a\r\nrefinement entirely peculiar to himself through the manner in which he\r\nbrought into accord the leading lines of landscape and the leading lines\r\nin his figures. A feeling for style, in the sense in which it was\r\nunderstood by the old painters, is everywhere dominant in his work, and\r\na handling of line and composition in the grand manner which placed him\r\nupon a level with the masters of art. A new and simple beauty was\r\nrevealed. And if it is true that it is only in the field of plastic art\r\nthat he has had, up to the present, any pupil of importance--and he had\r\none in Adolf Hildebrandt--it is, nevertheless, beyond question that the\r\nmonumental painting of the future is alone capable of being developed\r\nupon the ground prepared by Mar\xc3\xa9es.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   FLORA.]\r\n\r\nIn this more than anything, it seems to me, lies the significance of all\r\nthese masters. We must not lay too much stress upon the fact that they\r\ndealt with ideal and universal themes; a healthy art cannot be nourished\r\non bloodless ideals, but only on the living essence of its own epoch.\r\nWe must bear in mind, however, that a sound artistic principle has been\r\nformulated. A glance at the productions of classic art shows us that the\r\nold masters carefully considered the relation of a picture to its\r\nenvironment. Take, for instance, the Ravenna mosaics or Giotto\'s\r\nfrescoes. They must needs resound in solemn harmony the whole church\r\nthrough; looked at from any point of view they must make their presence\r\nfelt right away in the farthest distance: so both Giotto and the mosaic\r\nartists worked only in broad expressive lines, their forcible\r\ncolour-schemes were fitted together in accordance with strict decorative\r\nlaws. All naturalistic effects are avoided, all petty detail is left out\r\nin the flow of the drapery as well as in the structure of the landscape.\r\nThen the clear outlines tell out. The pictures must, when viewed from a\r\ndistance, simultaneously, in all their lines, carry on the lines of the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   IN THE TROUGH OF THE WAVES.]\r\n\r\nLater on, in the Netherlands, there arose another style of painting. In\r\nabrupt contrast to the monumental works of the Italian school we have\r\nJan van Eyck\'s tiny little pictures painted with a fine point, stroke by\r\nstroke, with the most minute exactitude. Every hair in the head, every\r\nvein in the hands, every ornament in the costume is drawn true to life.\r\nJan van Eyck knew what he was about with this fine-point style of art,\r\nfor his pictures did not lay claim to any effect from a distance; they\r\nwere meant to be looked at, like miniatures in the prayer-books, from\r\nthe closest point of view possible. They were little domestic\r\naltar-pieces: when anyone wanted to look at them, he drew the curtain\r\naside and knelt or stood just in front of them. The style of painting of\r\nthe later Dutch cabinet pictures is accounted for in the same way. These\r\npaintings were generally placed on an easel, as if to give the spectator\r\na gentle hint, "If you wish to fully appreciate the beauties of this\r\nlittle picture, please stand right in front." Even when the pictures\r\nwere meant to adorn the walls, the minute and dainty style of a Don or a\r\nMieris was appropriate, for the narrowness of the old Dutch rooms\r\nprecluded all possibility of the spectator\'s being able to stand far\r\naway from the picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Munich._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   THE SHEPHERD\'S PLAINT.]\r\n\r\nIf by chance one of these Dutch artists, Weenix for instance, had to do\r\nwork for a Flemish palace, he changed his style forthwith. He recognised\r\nthe fact that a picture, to be effective in a large state-room, must\r\ndiffer not only in size, but in composition and style of painting from\r\none that is meant for a small parlour. It is undoubtedly this lack of\r\nappreciation of the fact that a picture must be suitable to its\r\nsurroundings that has robbed the nineteenth century of any claim to\r\nstyle. What abominable daubs mural painters have foisted upon us in our\r\npublic buildings! The literary trend of the time drew away people\'s\r\nattention from the beauty of form and colour, and centred it upon the\r\ndidactic value of the works. Instead of starting from the idea that a\r\npicture should "adorn," they covered the walls with historical genre\r\npainting, never troubling themselves about decorative effect, and\r\noffered the beholder instructive stories in picture cards. As to art in\r\nthe home, well, we can all of us remember the time when small\r\nphotographs and etchings, instead of being kept in an album or a\r\nportfolio, were put on the wall, where they looked like mere spots of\r\ndead black and white. It was the same sort of thing in galleries and\r\nexhibitions, confusion worse confounded. On one and the same wall you\r\ngot the most heterogeneous collection, cabinet pictures by Brouwer or\r\nOstade next to an enormous altar-piece by Rubens, a gigantic Delacroix\r\nflanked by neat little Meissoniers. In this way the power of\r\nappreciating the significance of a work of art as part of the\r\ndecoration of a room was totally lost. Surely it is not to be wondered\r\nat that a picture seen close to in an exhibition, bought, taken home,\r\nhung on the wall and looked at from a distance, turns out a meaningless\r\nchaos of dirty-brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albert, Munich._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   AN IDYLL OF THE SEA.]\r\n\r\nIn the province of mural painting the tendency towards an improvement\r\nset in earliest. In England, France, and Germany, almost simultaneously\r\nefforts began to be made with the object of restoring to mural painting\r\nonce more its decorative element. In England Burne-Jones was the first\r\nto pay attention to harmony of style between picture and building.\r\nBefore his time English churches were provided with stained-glass\r\nwindows in a spurious sort of Cinquecento style that was absolutely\r\nunsuited to the building, but Burne-Jones satisfied the most exacting\r\ndemands of the English Neo-Gothic architecture. All his subjects are\r\nbrought into style with the slender pillars, the curves of the landscape\r\nas well as of the figures harmonise with the pointed arches of the\r\nbuilding. Everything, colour as well as line, is so simplified that the\r\npictures retain the clearness of their composition when seen from the\r\nfarthest possible standpoint. In France, Puvis de Chavannes travelled by\r\nanother road to the same goal. The decoration of the Pantheon was placed\r\nin his hands. Before him many artists had done work there, but the\r\npolicy of all of them had been to adopt the old style of oil-painting to\r\nmural decoration, and so they adorned the Pantheon as well, though it\r\nwas called a Grecian temple, with oil-paintings founded on Raphael or\r\nCaravaggio, mural pictures that would have been far better suited to a\r\nchurch of the Cinquecento or the _baroque_ period. Puvis was the first\r\nto realise that in the decoration of a building the artist must be\r\nstrictly controlled by the style of the architecture; so in his frescoes\r\nhe avoided all projections, all roundness, all wavy lines, bends, and\r\ncurves, and dealt exclusively with groups of vertical and horizontal\r\nlines, that followed the characteristic lines of pillar and architrave.\r\nSimilarly in the colours as well as the lines he excluded all detail\r\nthat would distract the attention, all confusion of colours that would\r\ndisturb the eye, and thereby gave his works the stately and dominant\r\neffect that they produce. Had Fate been kind, poor Hans von Mar\xc3\xa9es might\r\nhave won the same significance for Germany as Puvis did for France.\r\nThough individually his works are faulty, they are all informed with a\r\nmarvellous feeling for style; one observes how beautifully the lines of\r\nthe landscape are made to harmonise with the lines of the figures, and\r\nwith what a finely decorative quality the colours are combined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   VITA SOMNIUM BREVE.]\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner we must bring our minds to bear upon the problem of\r\nthe framed picture in connection with the decoration of a room. Our\r\nrooms are not only lighter but more spacious than the old-fashioned\r\nDutch parlours, with their leaded panes; so it was merely a hereditary\r\ntaint in our painters that made them cling so long to the ancestral\r\nstyle of painting, in spite of the altered conditions of the lighting\r\nand size of modern rooms. Impressionism did at any rate bring colour\r\nmore into harmony with the improved lighting of our rooms; yet in every\r\nart the sins of the fathers are visited upon their children. The\r\nImpressionists discovered atmosphere, and so they denied the existence\r\nof lines, and the outlines vanished into thin air; they discovered\r\nlight, and therefore they likewise denied the existence of colours. Then\r\nby means of light the colours were analysed, and patches of colour were\r\ndecomposed into a heterogeneous conglomeration of luminous points. The\r\nImpressionists simply revelled in the most delicate nuances of vague\r\ntones of indefinite colour, and as they eliminated from their work all\r\nsignificant lines and all strong and frank colours, they spoilt to a\r\ngreat extent the decorative effect of their pictures when viewed at a\r\ndistance: their paintings from that standpoint are often nothing more\r\nthan a daub of violet and yellow, without form and void.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  BOECKLIN.   THE ISLE OF THE DEAD.]\r\n\r\nThus towards the close of the nineteenth century there came under\r\ndiscussion a new problem again in the matter of picture painting. The\r\nquestion arose as to how decorative qualities might be arrived at in\r\npainting pure and simple. The way seems to be pointed out in the works\r\nof Moreau and Boecklin; the way in which they placed side by side\r\nbeautiful strong colours in broad masses, and invariably so as to avoid\r\nall discord, and combined the most conflicting tones into a harmonious\r\nwhole in a manner which words fail one to describe. It was delightful,\r\nafter having looked so long at nothing but the subtle, delicate nuances\r\nof the Impressionists, to turn again to these full-toned colours ringing\r\nout their deep and mighty harmonies.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely to be wondered at that the younger generation of the\r\npresent day refused to be bound by the principles of art laid down by\r\ntheir predecessors, notwithstanding the fact that Moreau, as well as\r\nBoecklin, was indebted to the Quattrocento for the mosaic-like\r\nbrilliancy of his colours. Impressionism has discovered a whole range of\r\nnew colour values by careful and intelligent study of the influence of\r\nlight upon colour, and where formerly we saw ten we now find a hundred.\r\nRed, green, blue have lost their meaning in the category of complex and\r\ninfinitely differentiated tones. So, as we advance from a realistic\r\ntranscript of impressions taken direct from nature to free, symphonic\r\ncompositions of the colours to which Impressionism has opened our eyes,\r\nwe shall evolve harmonies richer than were ever imagined before, more\r\nmelting than we ever dreamed of. This is the goal to which the efforts\r\nof the younger generation are primarily tending. Building upon the\r\nfoundations laid by the Impressionists, they seek to ensure for their\r\npictures both clearness and harmony, by simplification of form, by\r\nbeauty of technique, and by subordination of colour to the decorative\r\nscheme. Their confession of faith is comprised in the words of Paterson:\r\n"A picture must be something more than garbled Nature: it must please\r\nthe educated eye; and only so far as nature gives the painter his\r\nmaterial can he or dare he follow her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\nA SURVEY OF EUROPEAN ART AT THE PRESENT TIME\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nBy what means was the further development of painting in Europe brought\r\nabout under the influence of the principles of the two schools, the\r\nImpressionists and the Decorative-Stylists? The following may supply the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"Realism" having led painting from the past to the present, and\r\n"Impressionism" having broken the jurisdiction of the galleries by\r\nestablishing an independent conception of colour for a new class of\r\nsubjects, the flood of modern life, which had been artificially dammed,\r\nbegan to pour into art in all its volume. A whole series of new problems\r\nemerged, and a vigorous band of modern spirits were ready to lay hold\r\nupon them and give them artistic shape, each according to his nature,\r\nhis ability, and his individual knowledge and power. After\r\nnineteenth-century painting had found its proper field of activity they\r\nwere no longer under the necessity of seeking remote subjects. The fresh\r\nconquest of a personal impression of nature took the place of that\r\nretrospective taste which employed the ready-made language of form and\r\ncolour belonging to the old masters, as a vocabulary for the preparation\r\nof fresh works of art. Nature herself had become a gallery of splendid\r\npictures. Artists were dazzled as if by a new light, overcome as though\r\nby a revelation of tones and strains from which the painter was to\r\ncompose his symphonies. They learnt how to find what was pictorial and\r\npoetic in the narrowest family circle and amongst the beds of the\r\nsimplest vegetable garden; and for the first time they felt more wonder\r\nin the presence of reality, the joy of gradual discovery and of a\r\nleisurely conquest of the world.\r\n\r\nOf course, _plein-air_ painting was at first the chief object of their\r\nendeavours. Having painted so long only in brown tones, the radiant\r\nmagic world of free and flowing light was something so ravishingly novel\r\nthat for several years all their efforts were exclusively directed to\r\npossessing themselves once more of the sun, and substituting the clear\r\ndaylight for the clare-obscure which had reigned alone, void of\r\natmosphere. In this sunny brightness, flooded with light and air, they\r\nfound a crowd of problems, and turned to the perpetual discovery of new\r\nchords of colour. Sunbeams sparkling as they rippled through the leaves,\r\nand greyish-green meadows flecked with dust and basking under light,\r\nwere the first and most simple themes.\r\n\r\nThe complete programme, however, did not consist of painting in bright\r\nhues, but, generally speaking, in seizing truth of colour and altogether\r\nrenouncing artificial harmony in a generally accepted tone. Thus, after\r\nthe painting of daylight and sunlight was learnt, a further claim had\r\nstill to be asserted: the ideal of truth in painting had to be made the\r\nkeynote in every other task. For in the sun, light is no doubt white,\r\nbut in the recesses of the forest, in the moonshine, or in a dim place,\r\nit shines and is at the same time charged with colour. Night, or mist,\r\nwith its hovering and pervasive secrets, is quite as rich in beauties as\r\nthe radiant world of glistening sunshine. After seeing the summer sun on\r\nwood and water, it was a relief for the eye to behold the subdued, soft,\r\nand quiet light of a room. Upon the older and rougher painting of free\r\nlight there followed a preference for dusk, which has a softness more\r\npicturesque, a more tender harmony of colours, and more geniality than\r\nthe broad light of day. Artists studied clare-obscure, and sought for an\r\nenhancement of colour in it; they looked into the veil of night, and\r\naddressed themselves to a painting of darkness such as could only have\r\nproceeded from the _plein-air_ school. For this darkness of theirs is\r\nlikewise full of atmosphere, a darkness in which there is life and\r\nbreath and palpitation. In earlier days, when a night was painted,\r\neverything was thick and opaque, covered with black verging into yellow;\r\nto this latter error artists were seduced by the crusts of varnish upon\r\nold pictures. Now they learnt to interpret the mysterious life of the\r\nnight, and to render the bluish-grey atmosphere of twilight. Or if\r\nfigures were to be painted in a room, artists rendered the circulation\r\nof the air amid groups of people, which Correggio called "the ambient"\r\nand Velasquez "respiration." And there came also the study of artificial\r\nillumination--of the delicate coloured charm of many-coloured lanterns,\r\nof the flaring gas or lamp-light which streams through the glass windows\r\nof shops, flaring and radiating through the night and reflected in a\r\nblazing glow upon the faces of men and women. Under these purely\r\npictorial points of view the gradual widening of the range of subject\r\nwas completed.\r\n\r\nSo long as the acquisition of sunlight was the point in question,\r\nrepresentations from the life of artisans in town and country stood at\r\nthe centre itself of artistic efforts, because the conception and\r\ntechnical methods of the new art could be tested upon them with peculiar\r\nsuccess. And through these pictures painting came into closer sympathy\r\nwith the heart-beat of the age. At an epoch when the labouring man as\r\nsuch, and the political and social movement in civilisation, had become\r\nmatters of absorbing interest, the picture of artisans necessarily\r\nclaimed an important place in art; and one of the best sides of the\r\nmoral value of modern painting lies in its no longer holding itself in\r\nindifference aloof from these themes. When the century began, Hector and\r\nAgamemnon alone were qualified for artistic treatment, but in the\r\nnatural course of development the disinherited, the weary and\r\nheavy-laden likewise acquired rights of citizenship. In the passage\r\nwhere Vasari speaks of the Madonnas of Cimabue, comparing them with the\r\nolder Byzantine Virgins, he says finely that the Florentine master\r\nbrought more "goodness of heart" into painting. And perhaps the\r\nhistorians of the future will say the same about the art of the present.\r\n\r\nThe predilection for the disinherited was in the beginning to such an\r\nextent identified with the plain, straightforward painting of the\r\nproletariat that Naturalism could not be conceived at all except in so\r\nfar as it dealt with poverty: in making its first great successes it had\r\nsought after the miserable and the outcast, and serious critics\r\nrecognised its chief importance in the discovery of the fourth estate.\r\nOf course, the painting of paupers, as a sole field of activity for the\r\nnew art, would have been an exceedingly one-sided acquisition. It is not\r\nmerely the working-man who should be painted, because the age must\r\nstrive to compass in a large and full spirit the purport of its own\r\ncomplicated conditions of life. So there began, in general, the\r\nrepresentation, so long needed, of the man of to-day and of society\r\nagitated, as it is, by the stream of existence. As Zola wrote in the\r\nvery beginning of the movement: "Naturalism does not depend upon the\r\nchoice of subject. The whole of society is its domain, from the\r\ndrawing-room to the drinking-booth. It is only idiots who would make\r\nNaturalism the rhetoric of the gutter. We claim for ourselves the whole\r\nworld." Everything is to be painted,--forges, railway-stations,\r\nmachine-rooms, the workrooms of manual labourers, the glowing ovens of\r\nsmelting-works, official f\xc3\xaates, drawing-rooms, scenes of domestic life,\r\n_caf\xc3\xa9s_, storehouses and markets, the races and the Exchange, the clubs\r\nand the watering-places, the expensive restaurants and the dismal\r\neating-houses for the people, the _cabinets particuliers_ and _chic des\r\npremi\xc3\xa8res_, the return from the Bois and the promenades on the seashore,\r\nthe banks and the gambling-halls, casinos, boudoirs, studios, and\r\nsleeping-cars, overcoats, eyeglasses and red dress-coats, balls,\r\n_soir\xc3\xa9es_, sport, Monte Carlo and Trouville, the lecture-rooms of\r\nuniversities and the fascination of the crowded streets in the evening,\r\nthe whole of humanity in all classes of society and following every\r\noccupation, at home and in the hospitals, at the theatre, upon the\r\nsquares, in poverty-stricken slums and upon the broad boulevards lit\r\nwith electric light. Thus the new art flung aside the blouse, and soon\r\ndisplayed itself in the most various costumes, down to the frock-coat\r\nand the smoking-jacket. The rude and remorseless traits which it had at\r\nfirst, and which found expression in numbers of peasant, artisan, and\r\nhospital pictures, were subdued and softened until they even became\r\nidyllic. Moreover, the scale of painting over life-size, favoured in the\r\nearly years of the movement, could be abandoned, since it arose\r\nessentially from competition with the works of the historical school. So\r\nlong as those huge pictures covered the walls at exhibitions, artists\r\nwho obeyed a new tendency were forced from the beginning--if they wished\r\nto prevail--to produce pictures of the same size. But since historical\r\npainting was finally dead and buried, there was no need to set up such a\r\nstandard any longer, and a transition could be made to a smaller scale,\r\nbetter fitted for works of an intimate character. The dazzling tones in\r\nwhich the Impressionists revelled were replaced by those which were dim\r\nand soft, energy and force by subdued and tender treatment, largeness of\r\nsize by a scale which was small and intimate.\r\n\r\nThat was more or less the course of evolution run through in all\r\nEuropean countries in a similar way between the years 1875 and 1885.\r\nJust in the same way from this time onwards the Decorative-Stylists\'\r\ntendency set in universally. Hitherto everything was focused on the\r\n"picture as such." Tasteless novelty or methodless imitation held sway\r\nover the applied arts. The endeavours of the next decade aimed at\r\nfreeing the picture from its isolation and making the room itself a\r\nharmonious work of art. A long line of eminent artists took in hand the\r\nhitherto neglected subject of art in decoration; and as thereby new\r\nblood was infused into the applied arts, so on the other hand pictorial\r\nart in one way renounced its freedom to fit itself into its new frame.\r\nColour, which formerly was determined principally by the lighting, now\r\nbecame subordinate to a decorative scheme. Truth is no longer the end\r\nand aim of art, but fitness, harmony of form and colour values. It is,\r\nhowever, obviously impossible to give verse and chapter to the history\r\nof this development, just as it would be impossible to fix a boundary\r\nline between the two roads, the Impressionistic on the one hand and the\r\nDecorative on the other. We will wander free from one country to\r\nanother, and try to assign to each its proper place in the general chart\r\nof modern painting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nFRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, which for a hundred years had given the signal for all novel\r\ntactics in European art, still remained at the head of the movement; the\r\nartistic temperament of the French people themselves, and the\r\nsuperlatively excellent training which the painter enjoys in Paris,\r\nenable him at once to follow every change of taste with confidence and\r\nease. In 1883 Manet died, on the varnishing day of the Salon, and in the\r\npreface which Zola wrote to the catalogue of the exhibition held after\r\nthe death of the master he was well able to say: "His influence is an\r\naccomplished fact, undeniable, and making itself more deeply felt with\r\nevery fresh Salon. Look back for twenty years, recall those black\r\nSalons, in which even studies from the nude seemed as dark as if they\r\nhad been covered with mouldering dust. In huge frames history and\r\nmythology were smothered in layers of bitumen; never was there an\r\nexcursion into the province of the real world, into life and into\r\nperfect light; scarcely here or there a tiny landscape, where a patch of\r\nblue sky ventured bashfully to shine down. But little by little the\r\nSalons were seen to brighten, and the Romans and Greeks of mahogany to\r\nvanish in company with the nymphs of porcelain, whilst the stream of\r\nmodern representations taken from ordinary life increased year by year,\r\nand flooded the walls, bathing them with vivid tones in the fullest\r\nsunlight. It was not merely a new period; it was a new painting bent\r\nupon reaching the perfect light, respecting the law of colour values,\r\nsetting every figure in full light and in its proper place, instead of\r\nadapting it in an ideal fashion according to established tradition."\r\n\r\nWhen the way had been paved for this change, when the new principles had\r\nbeen transferred from the chamber of experiments to full publicity, from\r\nthe _Salon des Refus\xc3\xa9s_ to the Salon which was official, it was chiefly\r\n_Bastien-Lepage_ who gained the first adherents to them amongst the\r\npublic. But because he does not belong to the pioneers of art, and\r\nmerely adapted for the great public elements that had been won by Manet,\r\nthe immoderate praise which was accorded him in earlier days has been\r\nrecently brought within more legitimate limits. It has been urged, by\r\nway of restriction, that he stands in relation to Manet as Breton to\r\nMillet, and that, admitting all differences, he has nevertheless a\r\ncertain resemblance to his teacher, Cabanel. As the latter rendered\r\nClassicism elegant, Bastien-Lepage, it has been said, softened the\r\nruggedness of Naturalism, cut and polished the nails of his peasants,\r\nand made their rusticity a pretty thing, qualifying it for the\r\ndrawing-room. Degas was in the habit of calling him the Bouguereau of\r\nNaturalism. As a matter of fact, Naturalism was bound to make certain\r\nconcessions if it were ever to prevail, and such critics forget that it\r\nwas just these amiable concessions which helped the principles of Manet\r\nto prevail more swiftly than would have been otherwise possible. All the\r\nforms and ideas of the Impressionists, with which no one, outside the\r\ncircle of artists, had been able to reconcile himself, were to be found\r\nin Bastien-Lepage, purified, mitigated, and set in a golden style. He\r\nfollowed the _eclaireurs_, as the leader of the main body of the army\r\nwhich has gained the decisive battle, and in this way he has fulfilled\r\nan important mission in the history of art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._   JULES BASTIEN-LEPAGE.]\r\n\r\nBastien-Lepage was born in ancient Damvillers--once a small stronghold\r\nof Lorraine--in a pleasant, roomy house that told a tale of even\r\nprosperity rather than of wealth. As a boy he played amongst the\r\nvenerable moats which had been converted into orchards. Thus in his\r\nyouth he received the freshest impressions, being brought up in the\r\nheart of nature. His father drew a good deal himself, and kept his son\r\nat work with the pencil, without any \xc3\xa6sthetic theories, without any\r\nvague ideal, and without ever uttering the word "academy" or "museum."\r\nHaving left school in Verdun, Bastien-Lepage went to Paris to become an\r\nofficial in the post-office. Of an afternoon, however, he drew and\r\npainted with Cabanel. But he was Cabanel\'s pupil much as Voltaire was a\r\npupil of the Jesuits. "My handicraft," as he said afterwards, "I learnt\r\nat the Academy, but not my art. You want to paint what exists, and you\r\nare invited to represent the unknown ideal, and to dish up the pictures\r\nof the old masters. In old days I scrawled drawings of gods and\r\ngoddesses, Greeks and Romans, beings I didn\'t know, and didn\'t\r\nunderstand, and regarded with supreme indifference. To keep up my\r\ncourage, I repeated to myself that this was possibly \'grand art,\' and I\r\nask myself sometimes whether anything academical still remains in my\r\ncomposition. I do not say that one should only paint everyday life; but\r\nI do assert that when one paints the past it should, at any rate, be\r\nmade to look like something human, and correspond with what one sees\r\naround one. It would be so easy to teach the mere craft of painting at\r\nthe academies, without incessantly talking about Michael Angelo, and\r\nRaphael, and Murillo, and Domenichino. Then one would go home afterwards\r\nto Brittany, Gascony, Lorraine, or Normandy, and paint what lies around;\r\nand any morning, after reading, if one had a fancy to represent the\r\nProdigal Son, or Priam at the feet of Achilles, or anything of the kind,\r\none would paint such scenes in one\'s own fashion, without reminiscences\r\nof the galleries--paint them in the surroundings of the country, with\r\nthe models that one has at hand, just as if the old drama had taken\r\nplace yesterday evening. It is only in that way that art can be living\r\nand beautiful."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  BASTIEN-LEPAGE.   PORTRAIT OF HIS GRANDFATHER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. E. Bastien-Lepage, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the war fortunately prevented him from remaining long at\r\nthe Academy. He entered a company of Franc-Tireurs, took part in the\r\ndefence of Paris, and returned ill to Damvillers. Here he came to know\r\nhimself and his peculiar talent. At once a poet and a realist, he looked\r\nat nature with that simple frankness which those alone possess who have\r\nlearnt from youth upwards to see with their own eyes instead of trusting\r\nto other people\'s. His friends called him "primitive," and there was\r\nsome truth in what they said, for Bastien-Lepage came to art free from\r\nall trace of mannerism; he knew nothing of academical rules, and merely\r\nrelied upon his eyes, which were always open and trustworthy.\r\n\r\nLooking back as far as he could, he was able to remember nothing except\r\ngleaners bowed over the stubble-fields, vintagers scattered amid the\r\nfurrows of the vineyards, mowers whose robust figures rose brightly from\r\nthe green meadows, shepherdesses seeking shelter beneath tall trees\r\nfrom the blazing rays of the midday sun, shepherds shivering in their\r\nragged cloaks in winter, pedlars hurrying with great strides across the\r\nplain raked by a storm, laundresses laughing as they stood at their tubs\r\nbeneath the blossoming apple-trees. He was impressionable to everything:\r\nthe dangerous-looking tramp who hung about one day near his father\'s\r\nhouse; the wood-cutter groaning beneath the weight of his burden; the\r\npasser-by trampling the fresh grass of the meadows and leaving his trace\r\nbehind him; the little sickly girl minding her lean cow upon a wretched\r\nfield; the fire which broke out in the night and set the whole village\r\nin commotion. That was what he wanted to paint, and that is what he has\r\npainted. The life of the peasants of Lorraine is the theme of all his\r\npictures, the landscape of Lorraine is their setting. He painted what he\r\nloved, and he loved what he painted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  BASTIEN-LEPAGE.   THE FLOWER GIRL.]\r\n\r\nIt was in Damvillers that he felt at home as an artist. He had his\r\nstudio in the second storey of his father\'s house, though he usually\r\npainted in the open air, either in the field or the orchard, whilst his\r\ngrandfather, an old man of eighty, was near him clipping the trees,\r\nwatering the flowers, and weeding the grass. His mother, a genuine\r\npeasant, was always busy with the thousand cares of housekeeping. Of an\r\nevening the whole family sat together round the lamp, his mother sewing,\r\nhis father reading the paper, his grandfather with the great cat on his\r\nlap, and Jules working. It was at this time that he produced those\r\nfamiliar domestic scenes, thrown off with a few strokes, which were to\r\nbe seen at the exhibition of the works which he left behind him. He knew\r\nno greater pleasure than that of drawing again and again the portraits\r\nof his father and mother, the old lamp, or the velvet cap of his\r\ngrandfather. At ten o\'clock sharp his father gave the signal for going\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, indeed, other demands were made. In 1872 he painted, with the\r\nobject of being represented in the Salon, that remarkable picture "In\r\nthe Spring," the only one of his works which is slightly hampered by\r\nconventionality in conception. The pupil of Cabanel is making an effort\r\nat truth, and has not yet the courage to be true altogether. Here, as in\r\nthe "Spring Song" which followed, there is a mixture of borrowed\r\nsentiment, work in the old style and fresh Naturalism. The landscape is\r\npainted from nature, and the peasant woman is real, but the Cupids are\r\ntaken from the old masters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  BASTIEN-LEPAGE.   SARAH BERNHARDT.]\r\n\r\nThe next years were devoted to competitive labours. To please his father\r\nand mother Bastien-Lepage twice contested the _Prix de Rome_. In 1873 he\r\npainted as a prize exercise a "Priam before Achilles," and in 1875 an\r\n"Annunciation of the Angel to the Shepherds," that now famous picture\r\nwhich received the medal at the World Exhibition of 1878. And he who\r\nafterwards revelled in the clearest _plein-air_ painting here celebrates\r\nthe secret wonders of the night, though the influences of Impressionism\r\nare here already visible. In his picture the night is as dark as in\r\nRembrandt\'s visions; yet the colours are not harmonised in gold-brown,\r\nbut in a cool grey silver tone. And how simple the effect of the\r\nheavenly appearance upon the shepherds lying round the fire of coals!\r\nThe place of the curly ideal heads of the old sacred painting has been\r\ntaken by those of bristly, unwashed men who, nurtured amid the wind and\r\nthe weather, know nothing of those arts of toilette so much in favour\r\nwith the imitators of Raphael, and who receive the miracle with the\r\nsimplicity of elemental natures. Fear and abashed astonishment at the\r\nangelic appearance are reflected in their faces, and the plain and\r\nhomely gestures of their hands are in correspondence with their inward\r\nexcitement. Even the angel turning towards the shepherds was conceived\r\nin an entirely human and simple way. In spite of this, or just because\r\nof it, Bastien failed with his "Annunciation to the Shepherds," as he\r\nhad done previously with his "Priam." Once the prize was taken by L\xc3\xa9on\r\nComerre, a pupil of Cabanel, and on the other occasion by Josef Wencker,\r\nthe pupil of G\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me. It was written in the stars that Bastien-Lepage was\r\nnot to go to Rome, and it did him as little harm as it had done to\r\nWatteau a hundred and sixty years before. In Italy Bastien-Lepage would\r\nonly have been spoilt for art. The model for him was not one of the old\r\nClassic painters, but nature as she is in Damvillers,--Nature, the great\r\nmother. When the works sent in for the competition were exhibited a\r\nsensation was made when one day a branch of laurel was laid on the frame\r\nof Bastien-Lepage\'s "Annunciation to the Shepherds" by Sarah Bernhardt.\r\nAnd Sarah Bernhardt\'s portrait became the most celebrated of the small\r\nlikenesses which soon laid the foundation of the painter\'s fame.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of his grandfather, that marvellous work of a young man of\r\nfive-and-twenty, is the first picture in which he was completely\r\nhimself. The old man sits in a corner of the garden, just as usual, in a\r\nbrown cap, his spectacles upon his nose, his arms crossed upon his lap,\r\nwith a horn snuff-box and a check handkerchief lying upon his knees. How\r\nperfectly easy and natural is the pose, how thoughtful the physiognomy,\r\nwhat a personal note there is in the dress! Nor are there in that\r\ngarden, bathed in light, any of those black shadows which only fall in\r\nthe studio. Everything bore witness to a simplicity and sincerity which\r\njustified the greatest hopes. After that first work the world knew that\r\nBastien-Lepage was a preeminent portrait painter, and he did not betray\r\nthe promise of his youth. His succeeding pictures showed that he had not\r\nmerely rusticity and nature to rely upon, but that he was a _charmeur_\r\nin the best sense of the word.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  BASTIEN-LEPAGE.   MME. DROUET.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  BASTIEN-LEPAGE.   THE HAY HARVEST.]\r\n\r\nThis ingenuous artist, who knew nothing of the history of painting, and\r\nfelt more at home in the open air than in museums, was not ignorant, at\r\nany rate, of the portraits of the sixteenth century, and had chosen for\r\nhis likenesses a scale as small as that which Clouet and his school\r\npreferred. The representation here reaches a depth of characterisation\r\nwhich recalls Jan van Eyck\'s little pearls of portrait painting. In\r\nthese works also he mostly confined himself to bright lights. Portraits\r\nof this type are those of his brother, of Madame Drouet, the aged\r\nfriend of Victor Hugo, with her weary, gentle, benevolent face--a\r\nmasterpiece of intimate feeling and refinement; of his friend and\r\nbiographer Andr\xc3\xa9 Theuriet, of Andrieux the prefect of the police, and,\r\nabove all, the famous and signal work of inexorable truth and marvellous\r\ndelicacy, Sarah Bernhardt in profile, with her tangled chestnut hair,\r\nsitting upon a white fur, arrayed in a white China-silk dress with\r\nyellowish lights in it, and carefully examining a Japanese bronze. The\r\nbizarre grace of the tragic actress, her slender figure, fashioned, as\r\nit were, for Donatello, the nervous intensity with which she sits there,\r\nher weird Chinese method of wearing the hair, and the profile of which\r\nshe is so proud, have been rendered in none of her many likenesses with\r\nsuch an irresistible force of attraction as in this little masterpiece.\r\nIn some of his other portraits Bastien-Lepage has not disdained the\r\ncharm of obscure light; he has not done so, for example, in the little\r\nportrait of Albert Wolff, the art-critic, as he sits at his writing-desk\r\namongst his artistic treasures, with a cigarette in his hand. Only\r\nClouet and Holbein painted miniature portraits of such refinement.\r\nAmongst moderns, probably Ingres alone has reached such a depth of\r\ncharacterisation upon the smallest scale, and in general he is the most\r\nclosely allied to Bastien-Lepage as a portrait painter in profound study\r\nof physiognomy, and in the broad and, one might say, chased technique of\r\nhis little drawings. Comparison with Gaillard would be greatly to the\r\ndisadvantage of this great engraver, for Bastien-Lepage is at once more\r\nseductive and many-sided. It is curious how seldom his portraits have\r\nthat family likeness which is elsewhere to be found amongst almost all\r\nportrait painters. In his effort at penetrative characterisation he\r\nalters, on every occasion, his entire method of painting according to\r\nthe personality, so that it leaves at one time an effect that is\r\nbizarre, coquettish, and full of intellectual power and spirit, at\r\nanother one which is plain and large, at another one which is bashful,\r\nsparing, and _bourgeois_.\r\n\r\nAs a painter of peasant life he made his first appearance in 1878.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  BASTIEN-LEPAGE.   LE P\xc3\x88RE JACQUES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  BASTIEN-LEPAGE.   JOAN OF ARC.]\r\n\r\nIn the Salon of this year a sensation was made by a work of such truth\r\nand poetry as had not been seen since Millet; this was the "Hay\r\nHarvest." It is noon. The June sun throws its sultry beams over the mown\r\nmeadows. The ground rises slowly to a boundless horizon, where a tree\r\nemerges here and there, standing motionless against the brilliant sky.\r\nThe grey and the green of these great plains--it is as if the weariness\r\nof many toilsome miles rose out of them--weighed heavily upon one, and\r\ncreated a sense of forsaken loneliness. Only two beings, a pair of\r\nday-labourers, break the wide level scorched by a quivering, continuous\r\nblaze of light. They have had their midday meal, and their basket is\r\nlying near them upon the ground. The man has now lain down to sleep upon\r\na heap of hay, with his hat tilted over his eyes. But the woman sits\r\ndreaming, tired with the long hours of work, dazzled with the glare of\r\nthe sun, and overpowered by the odour of the hay and the sultriness of\r\nnoon. She does not know the drift of her thoughts; nature is working\r\nupon her, and she has feelings which she scarcely understands herself.\r\nShe is sunburnt and ugly, and her head is square and heavy, and yet\r\nthere lies a world of sublime and mystical poetry in her dull, dreamy\r\neyes gazing into a mysterious horizon. By this picture and "The Potato\r\nHarvest," which succeeded it in 1879, Bastien-Lepage, the splendid,\r\nplaced himself in the first line of modern French painters. This time he\r\nrenders the sentiment of October. The sandy fields, impregnated with\r\ndust, rest in a white, subdued light of noon; pale brown are the potato\r\nstalks, pale brown the blades of grass, and the roads are bright with\r\ndust; and through this landscape, with its wide horizon, where the\r\ntree-tops, half despoiled already, shiver in the wind, there blows _le\r\ngrand air_, a breeze strong as only Millet in his water-colours had the\r\nsecret of painting. With Millet he shares likewise the breath of tender\r\nmelancholy which broods so sadly over his pictures. "The Girl with the\r\nCow," the little Fauvette, that child of social misery--misery that lies\r\nsorrowful and despairing in the gaze of her eyes--is perhaps the most\r\ntouching example of his brooding devotion to truth. Her brown dress is\r\ntorn and dirty, while a grey kerchief borders her famished, sickly face.\r\nA waste, disconsolate landscape, with a frozen tree and withered\r\nthistles, stretches round like a boundless Nirvana. Above there is a\r\nwhitish, clear, tremulous sky, making everything paler, more arid and\r\nwearily bright; there is no gleam of rich luxuriant tints, but only dry,\r\nstinted colours; and not a sound is there in the air, not a scythe\r\ndriving through the grass, not a cart clattering over the road. There is\r\nsomething overwhelming in this union between man and nature. One thinks\r\nof the famous words of Taine: "Man is as little to be divided from the\r\nearth as an animal or a plant. Body and soul are influenced in the same\r\nway by the environment of nature, and from this influence the destinies\r\nof men arise." As an insect draws its entire nature, even its form and\r\ncolour, from the plant on which it lives, so is the child the natural\r\nproduct of the earth upon which it stands, and all the impulses of its\r\nspirit are reflected in the landscape.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 Bastien-Lepage went a step further. In that year appeared "Joan\r\nof Arc," his masterpiece in point of spiritual expression. Here he has\r\nrealised the method of treating historical pictures which floated before\r\nhim as an idea at the Academy, and has, at the same time, solved a\r\nproblem which beset him from his youth--the penetration of mysticism and\r\nthe world of dreams into the reality of life. "The Annunciation to the\r\nShepherds," "In Spring," and "The Spring Song" were merely stages on a\r\ncourse of which he reached the destination in "Joan of Arc." His ideal\r\nwas "to paint historical themes without reminiscences of the\r\ngalleries--paint them in the surroundings of the country, with the\r\nmodels that one has at hand, just as if the old drama had taken place\r\nyesterday evening."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  BASTIEN-LEPAGE.   THE BEGGAR.]\r\n\r\nThe scene of the picture is a garden of Damvillers painted exactly from\r\nnature, with its grey soil, its apple and pear-trees clothed with small\r\nleaves, its vegetable beds, and its flowers growing wild. Joan herself\r\nis a pious, careworn, dreamy country girl. Every Sunday she has been to\r\nchurch, lost herself in long mystic reveries before the old sacred\r\npictures, heard the misery of France spoken of; and the painted statues\r\nof the parish church and its tutelary saints pursue her thoughts. And\r\njust to-day, as she sat winding yarn in the shadow of the apple-trees,\r\nmurmuring a prayer, she heard of a sudden the heavenly voices speaking.\r\nThe spirits of St. Michael, St. Margaret, and St. Catharine, before\r\nwhose statues she has prayed so often, have freed themselves from the\r\nwooden images and float as light phantoms, as pallid shapes of mist,\r\nwhich will as suddenly vanish into air before the eyes of the dreaming\r\ngirl. Joan rises trembling, throwing her stool over, and steps forward.\r\nShe stands in motionless ecstasy stretching out her left arm, and gazing\r\ninto vacancy with her pupils morbidly dilated. Of all human phases of\r\nexpression which painting can approach, such mystical delirium is\r\nperhaps the hardest to render; and probably it was only by the aid of\r\nhypnotism, to which the attention of the painter was directed just then\r\nby the experiments of Charcot, that Bastien-Lepage was enabled to\r\nproduce in his model that look of religious rapture, oblivious to the\r\nwhole world, which is expressed in the vague glance of her eyes, blue as\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  BASTIEN-LEPAGE.   THE POND AT DAMVILLERS.]\r\n\r\n"Joan of Arc" was succeeded by "The Beggar," that life-size figure of\r\nthe haggard old tramp who, with a thick stick under his arm--of which he\r\nwould make use upon any suitable occasion--picks up what he can in the\r\nvillages, saying a paternoster before the doors while he begs. This time\r\nhe has been ringing at the porch of an ordinary middle-class dwelling,\r\nand he is sulkily thrusting into the wallet slung round his shoulders a\r\ngreat hunch of bread which a little girl has just given to him. There is\r\na mixture of spite and contempt in his eyes as he shuffles off in his\r\nheavy wooden shoes. And behind the doorpost the little girl, who, in her\r\npretty blue frock, has such a trim air of wearing her Sunday best, looks\r\nrather alarmed and glances timidly at the mysterious old man.\r\n\r\n"Un brave Homme," or "Le P\xc3\xa8re Jacques," as the master afterwards called\r\nthe picture, was to some extent a pendant to "The Beggar." He comes out\r\nof the wood wheezing, with a pointed cap upon his head and a heavy\r\nbundle of wood upon his shoulders, whilst at his side his little\r\ngrandchild is plucking the last flowers. It is November; the leaves have\r\nturned yellow and cover the ground. P\xc3\xa8re Jacques is providing against\r\nthe Winter. And the Winter is drawing near--death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  BASTIEN-LEPAGE.   THE HAYMAKER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mansell Photo._\r\n\r\n  L\'HERMITTE.   THE PARDON OF PLOURIN.]\r\n\r\nBastien-Lepage\'s health had never been good, nor was Parisian life\r\ncalculated to make it better. Slender and delicate, blond with blue eyes\r\nand a sharply chiselled profile--_tout petit, tout blond, les cheveux \xc3\xa0\r\nla bretonne, le nez retrouss\xc3\xa9 et une barbe d\'adolescent_, as Marie\r\nBaskirtscheff describes him--he was just the type which _Parisiennes_\r\nadore. His studio was besieged; there was no entertainment to which he\r\nwas not invited, no committee, no meeting to hold judgment over pictures\r\nat which he was not present. Amateurs fought for his works and asked for\r\nhis advice when they made purchases. Pupils flocked to him in numbers.\r\nHe was intoxicated with the Parisian world, enchanted with its modern\r\nelegance; he loved the vibration of life, and rejoiced in masked balls\r\nlike a child. Consumptive people are invariably sensuous, drinking in\r\nthe pleasures of life with more swift and hasty draughts. He then left\r\nParis and plunged into the whirlpool of other great cities. From\r\nSwitzerland, Venice, and London he came back with pictures and\r\nlandscapes. In London, indeed, he painted that beautiful picture "The\r\nFlower-Girl," the pale, delicate child upon whose faded countenance the\r\ntragedy of life has so early left its traces. Through the whole summer\r\nof 1882 he worked incessantly in Damvillers. Once more he painted his\r\nnative place in a landscape of the utmost refinement. Here, as in his\r\nportraits, everything has been rendered with a positive trenchancy, with\r\na severe, scientific effort after truth, in which there lies what is\r\nalmost a touch of aridness. And yet an indescribable magic is thrown\r\nover the fragrant green of the meadows, the young, quivering trees, and\r\nthe still pond which lies rippling in the cloudless summer day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Portfolio._\r\n\r\n  L\'HERMITTE.   PAY TIME IN HARVEST.]\r\n\r\nIn 1883 there appeared in the Salon that wonderful picture "Love in the\r\nVillage." The girl has hung up her washing on the paling, and the\r\nneighbour\'s son has run down with a flower in his hand; she has taken\r\nthe flower, and in confusion they have suddenly turned their backs upon\r\neach other, and stand there without saying a word. They love each other,\r\nand wish to marry, but how hard is the first confession. Note how the\r\nlad is turning his fingers about in his embarrassment; note the\r\nconfusion of the girl, which may be seen, although she is looking\r\ntowards the background of the picture; note the spring landscape, which\r\nis as fair as the figures it surrounds.\r\n\r\nIt is a tender dreamer who gives himself expression here--and love came\r\nto him also.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastically adored by the women in his school of painting, he had\r\nfound a dear friend in _Marie Baskirtscheff_, the distinguished young\r\nRussian girl who had become his pupil just as his fame began to rise. It\r\nis charming to see the enthusiasm with which Marie speaks of him in her\r\ndiary. "_Je peins sur la propre palette du vrai Bastien, avec des\r\ncouleurs \xc3\xa0 lui, son pinceau, son atelier, et son fr\xc3\xa8re pour mod\xc3\xa8le._"\r\nAnd how the others envy her because of it! "_La petite Su\xc3\xa9doise voulait\r\ntoucher \xc3\xa0 sa palette._" With Marie he sketched his plans for the future,\r\nand in the midst of this restless activity he was summoned hence\r\ntogether with her, for she also died young, at the age of twenty-four,\r\njust as her pictures began to create a sensation. A touching idyll in\r\nher diary tells how the girl learnt, when she was dying of consumption,\r\nthat young Bastien had also fallen ill, and been given up as hopeless.\r\nSo long as Marie could go out of doors she went with her mother and her\r\naunt to visit her sick friend; and when she was no longer allowed to\r\nleave the house he had himself carried up the steps to her drawing-room\r\nby his brother, and there they both sat beside each other in armchairs,\r\nand saw the end draw near, merciless and inevitable, the end of their\r\nyoung lives, their talents, their ambition, and their hopes. "At last!\r\nHere it is then, the end of all my sufferings! So many efforts, so many\r\nwishes, so many plans, so many ---- ----, and then to die at\r\nfour-and-twenty upon the threshold of them all!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._   L\xc3\x89ON L\'HERMITTE.]\r\n\r\nHer last picture was one of six schoolboys, sons of the people, who are\r\nstanding at a street corner chattering; and it makes a curiously virile\r\nimpression, when one considers that it was painted by a blond young\r\ngirl, who slept under dull blue silken bed-curtains, dressed almost\r\nentirely in white, was rubbed with perfumes after a walk in hard\r\nweather, and wore on her shoulders furs which cost two thousand francs.\r\nIt hangs in the Luxembourg, and for a long time a lady dressed in\r\nmourning used to come there every week and cry before the picture\r\npainted by the daughter whom she had lost so early. Marie died on 31st\r\nOctober 1884, and Bastien barely a month afterwards. "The Funeral of a\r\nYoung Girl," in which he wished to immortalise the funeral of Marie, was\r\nhis last sketch, his farewell to the world, to the living, alluring,\r\never splendid nature which he loved so much, grasped and comprehended so\r\nintimately, and to the hopes which built up their deceptive castles in\r\nthe air before his dying gaze. He died before he reached Raphael\'s age,\r\nfor he was barely thirty-six. The final collapse came on 10th December\r\n1884, upon a sad, rainy evening, after he had lain several months upon a\r\nbed of sickness. His frame was emaciated, and as light as that of a\r\nchild; his face was shrivelled--the eyes alone had their old brilliancy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  ROLL.   THE WOMAN WITH A BULL.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nOn 14th December his body was brought up to the Eastern railway station.\r\nThe coffin was covered with roses, white elder blossoms, and\r\nimmortelles. And now he lies buried in Lorraine, in the little\r\nchurchyard of Damvillers, where his father and grandfather rest beneath\r\nan old apple-tree. Red apple-blossoms he too loved so dearly. His\r\nimportance Marie Baskirtscheff has summarised simply and gracefully in\r\nthe words: "_C\'est un artiste puissant, originel, c\'est un po\xc3\xa8te, c\'est\r\nun philosophe; les autres ne sont que des fabricants de n\'importe quoi \xc3\xa0\r\nc\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 de lui.... On ne peut plus rien regarder quand on voit sa\r\npeinture, parce que c\'est beau comme la nature, comme la vie...._"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  ROLL.   MANDA LAM\xc3\x89TRIE, FERMI\xc3\x88RE.]\r\n\r\nThis tender poetic trait which runs through his works is what\r\nprincipally distinguishes him from _L\'hermitte_, the most sterling\r\nrepresentative of the picture of peasant life at the present time.\r\nL\'hermitte, also, like most of these painters of peasants, was himself\r\nthe son of a peasant. He came from Mont-Saint-P\xc3\xa8re, near\r\nCh\xc3\xa2teau-Thierry, a quiet old town, where from the great "Hill of\r\nCalvary" one sees a dilapidated Gothic church and the moss-grown roofs\r\nof thatched houses. His grandfather was a vine-grower and his father a\r\nschoolmaster. He worked in the field himself, and, like Millet, he\r\npainted afterwards the things which he had done himself in youth. His\r\nprincipal works were pictures of reapers in the field, peasant women in\r\nchurch, young wives nursing their children, rustics at work, here and\r\nthere masterly water-colours, pastels and charcoal drawings, in 1888 the\r\npretty illustrations to Andr\xc3\xa9 Theuriet\'s _Vie Rustique_, the decoration\r\nof a hall at the Sorbonne with representations of rustic life, in his\r\nlater period occasionally pictures from other circles of life, such as\r\n"The Fish-market of St. Malo," "The Lecture in the Sorbonne," "The\r\nMusical Soir\xc3\xa9e," and finally, as a concession to the religious tendency\r\nof recent years, a "Christ visiting the House of a Peasant." He has his\r\nstudio in the Rue Vaquelin in Paris, though he spends most of his time\r\nin the village where he was born, and where he now lives quietly and\r\nsimply with the peasants. Most of his works, which are to be ranked\r\nthroughout amongst the most robust productions of modern Naturalism, are\r\npainted in the great glass studio which he built in the garden of his\r\nfather\'s house. Whilst Bastien-Lepage, through a certain softness of\r\ntemperament, was moved to paint the weak rather than the strong, and\r\nless often men in the prime of life than patriarchs, women, and\r\nchildren, L\'hermitte displays the peasant in all his rusticity. He knows\r\nthe country and the labours of the field which make the hands horny and\r\nthe face brown, and he has rendered them in a strictly objective manner,\r\nin a great sculptural style. Bastien-Lepage is inclined to refinement\r\nand poetic tenderness; in L\'hermitte everything is clear, precise, and\r\nsober as pale, bright daylight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  RAFFAELLI.   PLACE ST. SULPICE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\n_Alfred Roll_ was born in Paris, and the artisan of the Parisian streets\r\nis the chief hero of his pictures. Like Zola in his Rougon-Macquart\r\nseries, he set before himself the aim of depicting the social life of\r\nthe present age in a great sequence of pictures--the workmen\'s strike,\r\nwar, and toil. His pictures give one the impression that one is looking\r\ndown from the window upon an agitated scene in the street. And his\r\nbroad, plebeian workmanship is in keeping with his rough and democratic\r\nsubjects. He made a beginning in 1875 with the colossal picture of the\r\n"Flood at Toulouse." The roofs of little peasants\' houses rise out of\r\nthe expanse of water. Upon one of them a group of country people have\r\ntaken refuge, and are awaiting a boat which is coming from the\r\ndistance. A young mother summons her last remnant of strength to save\r\nher trembling child. Beside her an old woman is sitting, sunk in the\r\nstupor of indifference, while in front a bull is swimming, bellowing\r\nwildly in the water. The influence of G\xc3\xa9ricault\'s "Raft of the Medusa"\r\nis indeed obvious; but how much more plainly and actually has the\r\nstruggle for existence been represented here, than by the great\r\nRomanticist still hampered by Classicism. The devastating effect of the\r\nmasses of water in all their elemental force could not have been more\r\nimpressively rendered than has been done through this bull struggling\r\nfor life with all its enormous strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  RAFFAELLI.   THE MIDDAY SOUP.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nIn technique this picture belongs to the painter\'s earlier phase. Even\r\nin the colouring of the naked figures it has still the dirty heaviness\r\nof the Bolognese. This bond which united him to the school of Courbet\r\nwas broken when--probably under the influence of Zola\'s _Germinal_--he\r\npainted "The Strike," in 1880. The stern reality which goes through\r\nZola\'s accounts of the life of pit-men is likewise to be found in these\r\nragged and starving figures, clotted with coal dust, assembling in\r\nsavage desperation before the manufactory walls, prepared for a rising.\r\nThe dull grey of a rainy November morning spreads above. In 1887 he\r\npainted war, war in the new age, in which one man is not pitted against\r\nanother, but great masses of men, who kill without seeing one another,\r\nare made to manoeuvre with scientific accuracy--war in which the\r\nballoon, distant signalling, and all the discoveries of science are\r\nturned to account. "Work" was the last picture of the series. There are\r\nmen toiling in the hot, dusty air of Paris with sandstones of all sizes.\r\nLife-size, upon life-size figures, the drops of sweat were seen upon the\r\napathetic faces, and the patches upon the blouses and breeches. Any one\r\nwho only reckons as art what is fine and delicate will necessarily find\r\nthese pictures brutal; but whoever delights in seeing art in close\r\nconnection with the age, as it really is, cannot deny to Alfred Roll\'s\r\ngreat epics of labour the value of artistic documents of the first rank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Studio._\r\n\r\n  RAFFAELLI.   THE CARRIER\'S CART.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nHe devoted himself to the more delicate problems of light, especially in\r\ncertain idyllic summer scenes, in which he delighted in painting\r\nlife-size bulls and cows upon the meadow, and beside them a girl,\r\nsometimes intended as a milkmaid and sometimes as a nymph. Of this type\r\nwas the picture of 1888, A Woman returning from Milking, "Manda\r\nLam\xc3\xa9trie, Fermi\xc3\xa8re." With a full pail she is going home across the sunny\r\nmeadow. Around there is a gentle play of light, a soft atmosphere\r\ntransmitting faint reflections, lightly resting upon all forms, and\r\nmildly shed around them. A yet more subtle study of light in 1889 was\r\nnamed "The Woman with a Bull." Pale sunbeams are rippling through the\r\nfluttering leaves, causing a delicious play of fine tones upon the nude\r\nbody of the young woman and the shining hide of the bull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  RAFFAELLI.   PARIS 4K. 1.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nOn a strip of ground in the suburbs of Paris, where the town has come to\r\nan end and the country has not yet begun, _Raffaelli_, perhaps the most\r\nspirited of the Naturalists, has taken up his abode. He has painted the\r\nworkman, the vagabond, the restlessness of the man who does not know\r\nwhere he is going to eat and sleep; the small householder, who has all\r\nhe wants; the ruined man, overtaken by misfortune, whose only remaining\r\npassion is the brandy-bottle,--he has painted them all amid the\r\nmelancholy landscape around Paris, with its meagre region still in\r\nembryo, and its great straight roads losing themselves disconsolately in\r\nthe horizon. Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier has written somewhere that the\r\ngeometricians are the ruination of landscapes. If he lived in these days\r\nhe would find, on the contrary, that those monotonous roads running\r\nstraight as a die give landscape a strange and melancholy grandeur. One\r\nthinks of the passage in Zola\'s _Germinal_, where the two socialists,\r\n\xc3\x89tienne and Suwarin, walk in the evening silently along the edge of a\r\ncanal, which, with the perpendicular stems of trees at its side,\r\nstretches for miles, as if measured with a pair of compasses, through a\r\nmonotonous flat landscape. Only a few low houses standing apart break\r\nthe straight line of the horizon; only here and there, in the distance,\r\ndoes there emerge a human being, whose diminished figure is scarcely\r\nperceptible above the ground. Raffaelli was the first to understand the\r\nvirginal beauty of these localities, the dumb complaining language of\r\npoverty-stricken regions spreading languidly beneath a dreary sky. He is\r\nthe painter of poor people and of wide horizons, the poet and historian\r\nof humanity living in the neighbourhood of great cities. There sits a\r\nhouse-owner, or the proprietor of a shop, in front of his own door;\r\nthere a pedlar, or a man delivering parcels, hurries across the field;\r\nthere a rag-picker\'s dog strays hungry about a lonely farmyard.\r\nSometimes the wide landscapes are relieved by the manufactories, water\r\nand gas-works which feed the huge crater of Paris. At other times the\r\nsnow lies on the ground, the skeletons of trees stand along the\r\nhigh-road, and a driver shouts to his team; the heavy cart-horses\r\ncovered with worsted cloths, shiver, and an impression of intense cold\r\nstrikes through you to your very bones. Indeed, Raffaelli\'s austerity\r\nwas first subdued a little when he came to make a lengthy residence in\r\nEngland. Then he acquired a preference for the light-coloured atmosphere\r\nand the gracious verdure of nature in England. He began to take pleasure\r\nin tender spring landscapes, in place of rigid scenes of snow. The poor\r\nsoil no longer seems so hard and inhospitable, but becomes attractive\r\nbeneath the soft, peaceful, bluish atmosphere. Even the uncivilised\r\nbeings, with famine in their eyes, who wandered about in his earliest\r\npictures, become milder and more resigned. The grandfather, in his\r\nblouse and wooden shoes, leads his grandchild by the hand amid the first\r\nshyly budding verdure. Old men sit quietly in the grounds of the\r\nalms-house, with the sun shining upon them. People no longer stand in\r\nthe mist of November evenings with their teeth chattering from the\r\nfrost, but breathe with delight the soft air of bright spring mornings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAFFAELLI.   THE HIGHROAD TO ARGENTEUIL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Studio._\r\n\r\n  RAFFAELLI.   LE CHIFFONIER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nRaffaelli, for fifteen years the master of this narrowly circumscribed\r\nregion, has recorded his impressions of it in an entirely personal\r\nmanner, in a style which in one of his _brochures_ he has himself\r\ndesignated "caract\xc3\xa9risme." And by comparing the costumed models in the\r\npictures of the previous generation with the figures of Raffaelli, the\r\nhappiness of this phrase is at once understood. In fact, Raffaelli is a\r\ngreat master of characterisation, and perhaps nowhere more trenchant\r\nthan in the illustrations which he drew for the _Revue Illustr\xc3\xa9e_.\r\nSpirited caricatures of theatrical representations alternate with the\r\ngrotesque figures of the Salvation Army. Yet he feels most in his\r\nelement when he dives into the horrors of Paris by night. The types\r\nwhich he has created live; they meet you at every step, wander about\r\nthe boulevards in the caf\xc3\xa9s and outside the barriers, and they haunt you\r\nwith their looks of misery, vice, and menace.\r\n\r\n_Giuseppe de Nittis_, an Italian turned a Parisian, a bold, searching,\r\nnervously excitable spirit, was the first _gentilhomme_ of\r\nImpressionism, the first who made a transition from the rugged painting\r\nof the proletariat to coquettish pictures from the fashionable quarters\r\nof the city, and reconciled even the wider public to the principles of\r\nImpressionism by the delicate flavouring of his works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  DE NITTIS.   PARIS RACES.]\r\n\r\n"It was a cold November morning. Cold it was certainly, but in\r\ncompensation the morning vapour was as fine as snow turned into mist.\r\nYonder in the crowded, populous, sooty quarters of the city, in Paris\r\nbusy with trade and industry, this early vapour which settles in the\r\nbroad streets is not to be found; the hurry of awakening life, and the\r\nconfused movement of country carts, omnibuses, and heavy, rattling\r\nfreight-waggons, have scattered, divided, and dispersed it too quickly.\r\nEvery passer-by bears it away on his shabby overcoat, on his threadbare\r\ncomforter, or disperses it with his baggy gloves. It dribbles down the\r\nshivering blouses and the waterproofs of toiling poverty, it dissolves\r\nbefore the hot breath of the many who have passed a sleepless or\r\ndissipated night, it is absorbed by the hungry, it penetrates into shops\r\nwhich have just been opened, into gloomy backyards, and it floats up the\r\nstaircases, dripping on the walls and banisters, right up to the frozen\r\nattics. And that is the reason why so little of it remains outside. But\r\nin the spacious and stately quarter of Paris, upon the broad boulevards\r\nplanted with trees and the empty quays the mist lay undisturbed, section\r\nover section, like an undulating mass of transparent wool in which one\r\nfelt isolated, hidden, almost imbedded in splendour, for the sun rising\r\nlazily on the distant horizon already shed a mild purple glow, and in\r\nthis light the mist level with the tops of the houses shone like a piece\r\nof muslin spread over scarlet."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  HEILBUTH.   FINE WEATHER.]\r\n\r\nThis opening passage in Daudet\'s _Le Nabab_ most readily gives the mood\r\nawakened by Giuseppe do Nittis\' Parisian landscapes. De Nittis was born\r\nin 1846 at Barletta, near Naples, in poor circumstances. In 1868, when\r\nhe was two-and-twenty years of age, he came to Paris, where G\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me and\r\nMeissonier interested themselves in him. Intercourse with Manet led him\r\nto his range of subject. He became the painter of Parisian street-life\r\nas it is to be seen in the neighbourhood of the quays, the painter of\r\nmist, smoke, and air. The Salons of 1875 and 1876 contained his first\r\npictures, the "Place des Pyramides" and the view of the Pont Royal, fine\r\nstudies of mist with a tremulous grey atmosphere, out of which graceful\r\nlittle figures raise their faint, vanishing outlines. From that time he\r\nhas stood at the centre of artistic life in Paris. He observed\r\neverything, saw everything, painted everything--a strip of the\r\nboulevards, the Place du Carrousel, the Bois de Boulogne, the races, the\r\nChamps Elys\xc3\xa9es, in the daytime with the budding chestnuts, the\r\nflower-beds blooming in all colours, the playing fountains, the women of\r\ngrace and beauty, and the light carriages which crowd between the Arc de\r\nTriomphe, the Obelisk, and the Gardens of the Tuileries, and in the\r\nevening when chains of white and coloured lights flash among the dark\r\ntrees. De Nittis has interpreted all atmospheric phases. He seized the\r\nintangible, the vibration of vapour, the dust of summer, and the rains\r\nof December days. He breathed the atmosphere, as it were, with his eyes,\r\nand felt with accuracy its greater or its diminished density. The great\r\npublic he gained by his exquisite sense of feminine elegance. Of\r\nmarvellous charm are the figures which give animation to the Place des\r\nPyramides, the Place du Carrousel, the Quai du Pont Neuf--women in the\r\nmost coquettish toilettes, men chatting together as they lean against a\r\nnewspaper kiosk, flower-girls offering bouquets, loiterers carelessly\r\nturning over the books exposed for sale upon a stall, _bonnes_ with\r\nshort petticoats and broad ribbons, smart-looking boys with hoops, and\r\nlittle girls with the air of great ladies. Since Gabriel de Saint\r\nAubin, Paris has had no more faithful observer. "De Nittis," said\r\nClaretie in 1876, "paints modern French life for us as that brilliant\r\nItalian, the Abb\xc3\xa9 Galliani, spoke the French language--that is to say,\r\nbetter than we do it ourselves."\r\n\r\nThe summit of his ability was reached in his last pictures from England.\r\nOne knows the London fogs of November, which hover over the town as\r\nblack as night, so that the gas has to be lit at noon, fogs which are\r\nsuffocating and shroud the nearest houses in a veil of crape. Scenes\r\nlike this were made for de Nittis\' brush. He roamed about in the smoke\r\nof the city, observed the fashion of the season, the confusion of cabs\r\nand drays upon London Bridge, the surge and hurry of the human stream in\r\nCannon Street, the vast panorama of the port of London veiled with smoke\r\nand fog, the fashionable West End with its magnificent clubs, the green,\r\nquiet squares and great, plainly built mansions; he studied the dense\r\nsmoky atmosphere of fog compressed into floating phantom shapes, the\r\nremarkable effects of light seen when a fresh breeze suddenly drives the\r\nblack clouds away. And again his eye adapted itself at once to the novel\r\nenvironment. It was not merely the blithe splendour of Paris that found\r\nan incomparable painter in Giuseppe de Nittis, but London also with its\r\nthick atmosphere and that mixture of damp, tawny fog and grey smoke.\r\nPiccadilly, the National Gallery, the railway bridge at Charing Cross,\r\nthe Green Park, the Bank, and Trafalgar Square are varied samples of\r\nthese English studies, which showed British painters themselves that not\r\none of them had understood the foggy atmosphere of London as this\r\ntourist who was merely travelling through the town. "Westminster" and\r\n"Cannon Street," a pair of dreary, sombre symphonies in ash-grey,\r\nperhaps display the highest of what De Nittis has achieved in the\r\npainting of air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._   ULYSSE BUTIN.]\r\n\r\nBorn in Hamburg, though a naturalised Frenchman, _Ferdinand Heilbuth_\r\ntook up again the _cult_ of the _Parisienne_ in the wake of Stevens, and\r\nas he turned the acquisitions of Impressionism to account in an\r\nexceedingly pleasing manner he seems, in comparison with Stevens,\r\nlighter and more vaporous and gracious. He painted water-scenes, scenes\r\non the greensward or in the entrance squares of ch\xc3\xa2teaux, placing in\r\nthese landscapes girls in fashionable summer toilette. He was\r\nparticularly fond of representing them in a white hat, a white or\r\npearl-grey dress with a black belt and long black gloves, in front of a\r\nbright grey stream, seated upon a fallen trunk, with a parasol resting\r\nagainst it. The bloom of the atmosphere is harmonised in the very finest\r\nchords with the virginal white of their dresses and the fresh verdure of\r\nthe landscapes. His pictures are little Watteaus of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, as discreet in effect as they are piquant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  BUTIN.   THE DEPARTURE.]\r\n\r\nAfter Heilbuth\'s death _Albert Aublet_, who in earlier days depicted\r\nsanguinary historical pieces, became the popular painter of girls, whose\r\nbeauties are gracefully interpreted in his pictures. When he paints the\r\ncomposer Massenet, sitting at the piano surrounded by flowers and\r\nbeautiful women,--when he represents the doings of the fashionable world\r\non the shore at a popular watering-place, or young ladies plucking\r\nroses, or wandering meditatively in bright dresses amid green shrubs and\r\nyellow flowers, or going into the sea in white bathing-gowns, there may\r\nbe nothing profound or particularly artistic in it all, but it is none\r\nthe less charming, attractive, bright, joyous, and fresh.\r\n\r\n_Jean B\xc3\xa9raud_, another interpreter of Parisian elegance, has found\r\nmaterial for numerous pictures in the blaze of the theatres, the naked\r\nshoulders of ballet-girls, the dress-coats of old gentlemen, the\r\nevening humour of the boulevards, the mysteries of the Caf\xc3\xa9 Anglais, the\r\nbustle of Monte Carlo, and the footlights of the Caf\xc3\xa9-Concert. But\r\nabsolute painter he is not. One would prefer to have a less oily\r\nheaviness in his works, a bolder and freer execution more in keeping\r\nwith the lightness of the subject, and for this one would willingly\r\nsurrender the touches of _genre_ which B\xc3\xa9raud cannot let alone even in\r\nthese days. But his illustrations are exceedingly spirited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  DANTAN.   A PLASTER CAST FROM NATURE.]\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to classify painters according to further\r\nspecialties. In fact, it is as little possible to bring individuals into\r\ncategories as it was at the time of the Renaissance, when the painter\r\nbusied himself at the same time with sculpture, architecture, and the\r\nartistic crafts. Great artists do not wall themselves up in a narrow\r\nspace to be studied. Liberated from the studio and restored to nature,\r\nthey endeavour, as in the best periods of art, to encompass life as\r\nwidely as possible. A mere enumeration, such as chance offers, and such\r\nas will preserve a sense for the individuality of every man\'s talent\r\nwithout attempting comparisons, seems therefore a better method to\r\npursue than a systematic grouping which could only be attained\r\nartificially and by ambiguities.\r\n\r\nThe late _Ulysse Butin_ settled down on the shore of the Channel and\r\npainted the life of the fishermen of Villerville, a little spot upon the\r\ncoast near Honfleur. Sturdy, large-boned fellows drag their nets across\r\nthe strand, carry heavy anchors ashore, or lie smoking upon the dunes.\r\nThe rays of the evening sun play upon their clothes; the night falls,\r\nand a profound silence rests upon the landscape.\r\n\r\nBy preference _\xc3\x89douard Dantan_ has painted the interiors of sculptors\'\r\nstudios--men turning pots, casting plaster, or working on marble, with\r\ngrey blouses, contrasting delicately with the light grey walls of\r\nworkrooms which are themselves flooded with bright and tender light.\r\nVery charming was "A Plaster Cast from Nature," painted in 1887: in the\r\ncentre was a nude female figure most naturally posed, whilst a fine,\r\neven atmosphere, which lay softly upon the girl\'s form, streaming gently\r\nover it, was shed around.\r\n\r\nHaving cultivated in the beginning the province of feminine nudity with\r\nlittle success, in such pictures as "The Bacchante" of the Luxembourg,\r\n"The Woman with the Mask," and "Rolla," _Henri Gervex_, the spoilt child\r\nof contemporary French painting, turned to the lecture-rooms of the\r\nuniversities, and by his picture of Dr. P\xc3\xa9an at La Salp\xc3\xa9tri\xc3\xa8re gave the\r\nimpulse to the many hospital pictures, surgical operations, and so forth\r\nwhich have since inundated the Salon. With the upper part of her body\r\nlaid bare and her lips half opened, the patient lies under the influence\r\nof narcotics, whilst P\xc3\xa9an\'s assistant is counting her pulse. His\r\naudience have gathered round. The light falls clear and peacefully into\r\nthe room. Everything is rendered simply, without diffidence, and with\r\nconfidence and quietude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  GERVEX.   DR. P\xc3\x89AN AT LA SALP\xc3\x89TRI\xc3\x88RE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\n_Duez_, when he had had his first success in 1879 with a large religious\r\npicture--the triptych of Saint Cuthbert in the Luxembourg--appeared with\r\nanimal pictures, landscapes, portraits, or fashionable representations\r\nof life in the streets and caf\xc3\xa9s. In the hands of such mild and\r\ncomplacent spirits as _Friant_ and _Goeneutte_, Naturalism fell into a\r\nmincing, lachrymose condition; but in a series of quiet, unpretentious\r\npictures _Dagnan-Bouveret_ was more successful in meeting the growing\r\ninclination of recent years for contemplative repose, just as in the\r\nprovince of literature Ohnet, Malot, and Claretie, with their spirit of\r\ncompromise, came after those stern naturalists Flaubert and Zola.\r\nAccording to the drawing of Paul Renouard, Dagnan-Bouveret is a little,\r\nblack-haired man with a dark complexion and deep-set eyes, a short blunt\r\nnose, and a black pointed beard. There is nothing in him which betrays\r\nspirit, caprice, and audacity, but everything which is an indication of\r\npatience and endurance; and, as a matter of fact, such are the qualities\r\nby which he has gained his high position. He is a man of poetic talent,\r\nthough rather tame, and stands to Bastien-Lepage and Roll as Breton to\r\nMillet. One often fancies that it is possible to observe in him that\r\nGerman _Gem\xc3\xbcth_, that genial temper, for the satisfaction of which Frau\r\nMarlitt provided in fiction. A pupil of G\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me, he made his first great\r\nsuccess in the Salon of 1879 with the picture "A Wedding at the\r\nPhotographer\'s." This was succeeded in 1882 by "The Nuptial\r\nBenediction"; in 1883 by "The Vaccination"; in 1884 by "The Horse-pond"\r\nof the Mus\xc3\xa9e Luxembourg; in 1885 by a "Blessed Virgin," a homely,\r\nthoughtful, and delicately coloured picture which gained him many\r\nadmirers in Germany; and in 1886 by "The Consecrated Bread," in which he\r\nwas one of the first to take up the study of light in interiors. In a\r\nCatholic church there are sitting devout women--most of them old, but\r\nalso one who is young--and children, while an acolyte is handing them\r\nconsecrated bread. This simple scene in the damp village church, filled\r\nwith a tender gloom, is rendered with a winning homely plainness, and\r\nwith that touch of compassionate sentimentality which is the peculiar\r\nnote of Dagnan-Bouveret. The "Bretonnes au Pardon" of 1889 thoroughly\r\ndisplayed this definitive Dagnan: a soft, peaceful picture, full of\r\nsimple and cordial poetry. In the grass behind the church, the plain\r\nspire of which rises at the end of a wall, women are sitting, both young\r\nand old, in black dresses and white caps. One of them is reading a\r\nprayer from a devotional book. The rest are listening. Two men stand at\r\nthe side. Everything is at peace; the scheme of colour is soft and\r\nquiet, while in the execution there is something recalling Holbein, and\r\nthe effect is idyllically moving like the chime of a village bell when\r\nthe sun is going down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  DUEZ.   ON THE CLIFF.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art_\r\n\r\n  DUEZ.   THE END OF OCTOBER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nThe zeal with which painters took up the study of contemporary life, so\r\nlong neglected, did not, however, prevent the quality of French\r\nlandscape painting from being exceedingly high. New parts of the world\r\nwere no longer to be conquered. For fifteen years none of the nobler,\r\nnor of the less noble, landscapes of France had been neglected, nor any\r\nstrip of field; there were no flowers that were not plucked, whether\r\nthey were cultivated in forcing-houses or had sprung pallid in a dark\r\ngarden of old Paris. It was only the joy in brightness and the newly\r\ndiscovered beauty of sunshine that brought with them any change of\r\nmaterial. Following the Impressionists, the landscape painters deserted\r\ntheir forests. Those "woodland depths," such as Diaz and Rousseau\r\npainted, seldom appear in the works of the most modern artists. In the\r\nseverest opposition to such once popular scenes there lies the plain,\r\nthe wide expanse stretching forth like a carpet in bright, shining tones\r\nunder the play of tremulous sunbeams, and scarcely do a few trees break\r\nthe quiet line of the distant horizon. At first the poorest and most\r\nhumble corners were preferred. The painting of the poor brought even the\r\nmost forlorn regions into fashion. Later, in landscape also, a bent\r\ntowards the most tender lyricism corresponded with that inclination to\r\nidyllic sentiment which was on the increase in figure painting. These\r\npainters have a peculiar joy in the fresh mood of morning, when a light\r\nvapour hovers over the meadows and the waters, before it is dissolved\r\ninto shining dew. They love the bloom of fruit-trees and the first smile\r\nof spring, or revel in the gradations of the dusk, rich as they are in\r\nshades of tint, mistily wan and grey, pale lilac, delicate green, and\r\nmilky blue. The perspective is broad and fine; objects are entirely\r\nabsorbed by the harmony of colour, and the older and coarser treatment\r\nof free light heightened to the most refined play by the most delicate\r\nshades of hue. And these colourists deriving from Corot, with their soft\r\ngrey enveloping all, are opposed by others who strike novel and higher\r\nchords upon the keyboard of Manet--landscape painters whom such simple\r\nand intimate things do not satisfy, but who search after unexpected,\r\nfleeting, and extraordinary impressions, analysing fantastically\r\ncombined effects of light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  DAGNAN-BOUVERET.   CONSECRATED BREAD.]\r\n\r\nA group of New-Impressionists, who might be called prismatic painters,\r\nstand in this respect at the extreme left. Starting from the conviction\r\nthat the traditional mixing of colours upon the palette results after\r\nall only in palette tones, and can never fully express the intensity and\r\npulsating vividness of tone-values, they founded the theory of the\r\nresolution of tones,--in other words, they break up all compound colours\r\ninto their primary hues, set these directly upon the canvas, and leave\r\nit to the eye of the spectator to undertake the mixture for itself. In\r\nparticular _George Seurat_ was an energetic disseminator of this\r\npainting in points which excited new discussions amongst artists and new\r\npolemics in the newspapers. His pictures were entirely composed of\r\nflaming, glowing, and shining patches. Close to these pictures nothing\r\nwas to be seen but a confusion of blotches, but at the proper distance\r\nthey took shape as wild sea-studies in the brilliant hues of noon, with\r\nrocks and stones standing out in relief, orgies of blue, red, and\r\nviolet. Such was Seurat\'s manner of seeing nature. That such a course\r\nbrings with it a good deal of monotony, that it will hardly ever be\r\npossible to quicken art to this extent with science, is incontestable.\r\nBut it is just as certain that Seurat was a painter of distinction who\r\nshows in many of his pictures a fine sense for delicate, pale\r\natmosphere. Many of his landscapes, which at close quarters look like\r\nmosaics of small, smooth, variously coloured stones, acquire a vibrating\r\nlight, such as Monet himself did not attain, when looked at from a\r\nproper distance. _Signac_, _Anquetin_, _Angrand_, _Lucien Pissarro_,\r\n_Coss_, _Lu\xc3\xa8c_, _Rysselberghe_, and _Valtat_ are the names of the other\r\nrepresentatives of this scientific painting, and their method has not\r\nseldom enabled them to give expression in an overpowering manner to the\r\nquiet of water and sky, the green of the meadows, and the softness of\r\ntender light shifting over the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  DAGNAN-BOUVERET.   BRETONNES AU PARDON.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nWhen these "spotted" pictures hang in a room where they are fewer in\r\nnumber than ordinary paintings they are difficult to understand. Only\r\nthe disadvantages of such a method of painting are noticed; the\r\ndisagreeable spottiness of the little points of colour ranged\r\nunpleasantly side by side, and putting one in mind of a piece of\r\nembroidery work, does not exactly appeal to the artist who looks for\r\nbeautiful lines and _belle p\xc3\xa2te_ in a picture. Nevertheless, the method\r\nwould scarcely have found so many exponents did it not afford an\r\nopportunity to get certain effects which are scarcely obtainable in any\r\nother way. As a matter of fact, one finds in these pictures a sense of\r\nlife, such shimmering, glimmering effects, such tremulous, vibrating\r\nlight, as could not be arrived at without this disintegration of colour\r\ninto separate points. Moreover, they have at a distance a decorative\r\neffect that leaves other pictures far behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  DAGNAN-BOUVERET.   THE NUPTIAL BENEDICTION.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Boussod, Valadon & Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nThe importance of Neo-Impressionism, therefore, depends on two\r\nparticulars. First, in the analysis of light it has carried the\r\nprinciples of Impressionism to their furthest limit; secondly, in the\r\nmatter of decorative effect it has laid aside one great fault of\r\nImpressionism, and has given us pictures which, seen from a distance,\r\ntake on a definite form instead of a blur of indistinct tones.\r\n\r\nAmongst the younger painters exhibiting in the Salon,\r\n_Pointelin_--without any trace of imitation--perhaps comes nearest to\r\nthe tender poetry of Corot, and has with most subtlety interpreted the\r\ndelicate charm of cold moods of morning, the deep feeling of still\r\nsolitude in a wide expanse. _Jan Monchablon_ views the meadow and the\r\ngrass, the blades and variegated flowers of the field, with the eyes of\r\na primitive artist. Wide stretches of rolling ground upon radiant spring\r\ndays are usually to be seen in his pictures. The sun shines, the grass\r\nsparkles, and the horizon spreads boundless around. In the background\r\ncows are grazing, or there move small figures bathed in air, whilst a\r\ndreamy rivulet murmurs in the foreground. The bright, soft light of\r\nProvence is the delight of _Montenard_, and he depicts with delicacy\r\nthis landscape with its bright, rosy hills, its azure sky, and its pale\r\nunderwood. Light, as he sees it, has neither motes nor shadows; its\r\nvibration is so intense and fine that it fills the air with liquid gold,\r\nand absorbs the tints of objects, wrapping them in a soft and mystic\r\ngolden veil.\r\n\r\n_Dauphin_, who is nearly allied with him, always remains a colourist.\r\nHis painting is more animated, provocative, and blooming, especially in\r\nthose sea-pieces with their bright harbours, glittering waves, and\r\nrocking ships with their sails shimmering and coquetting in the\r\nsunshine. The name of _Rosset-Granget_ recalls festal evenings, houses\r\nall aglow with lights and fireworks, or red lanterns shedding forth\r\ntheir gleam into the dark blue firmament, and reflected with a thousand\r\nfine tints in the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dial._\r\n\r\n  LUCIEN PISSARRO.   SOLITUDE (WOODCUT).]\r\n\r\nThe melancholy art of _\xc3\x89mile Barau_, a thoroughly rustic painter, who\r\nrenders picturesque corners of little villages with an extremely\r\npersonal accent, stands in contrast with the blithe painting of the\r\ndevotees of light; it is not the splendour of colour that attracts him,\r\nbut the dun hues of dying nature. He has come to a halt immediately in\r\nfront of Paris, in the square before the church of Creile. He knows the\r\nloneliness of village streets when the people are at work in the fields,\r\nand the houses give a feeling that their inhabitants are not far off and\r\nmay return at any moment. His pictures are harmonies in grey. The\r\nleading elements in his works are the pale light lying upon colourless\r\nautumn sward, the mournful outlines of leafless trees stretching their\r\nnaked boughs into the air as though complaining, small still ponds where\r\nducks are paddling, the scanty green of meagre gardens, the muddy waters\r\nof old canals, reddish-grey roofs and narrow little streets amid\r\nmoss-covered hills, tall poplars and willows by the side of swampy\r\nditches, and in the background the old village steeple, which is\r\nscarcely ever absent. _Damoye_, likewise, is fond of twilight, and\r\nautumn and winter evenings. He is the poet of the great plains and dunes\r\nand the sombre heaven, where isolated sunbeams break shyly from behind\r\nwhite clouds. A fine sea-painter, _Boudin_, studies in Etretat,\r\nTrouville, Saint Valery, Crotoy, and Berck the dunes and the misty sky,\r\nspreading in cold northern grey across the silent sea. _Dumoulin_ paints\r\nnight landscapes with deep blue shadows and bright blue lights, while\r\n_Albert Lebourg_ has a passion for the grey of rain and the glittering\r\nsnow which gleams in the light, blue in one place, violet and rosy in\r\nanother. _Victor Binet_ and _R\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9 Billotte_ have devoted themselves to\r\nthe study of that poor region, still in embryo, which lies around Paris,\r\na region where a delicate observer finds so much that is pictorial and\r\nso much hidden poetry. Binet is so delicate that everything grows nobler\r\nbeneath his brush. He specially loves to paint the poetry of twilight,\r\nwhich softens forms and tinges the trees with a greyish-green, the\r\nquiet, monotonous plains where tiny footpaths lose themselves in\r\nmysterious horizons, the expiring light of the autumn sun playing with\r\nthe fallen yellow leaves upon dusty highways. R\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9 Billotte\'s life is\r\nexceedingly many-sided. In the forenoon he is an important ministerial\r\nofficial, in the evening the polished man of society in dress-clothes\r\nand white tie whom Carolus Duran painted. Of an afternoon, in the hours\r\nof dusk and moonrise, he roams as a landscape painter in the suburbs of\r\nParis; he is an exceedingly accomplished man of the world, who only\r\nspeaks in a low tone, and what he specially loves in nature, too, is the\r\nhour when moonlight lies gently and delicately over all forms. The\r\nscenes he usually chooses are a quarry with light mist settling over it,\r\na light-coloured cornfield in a bluish dusk, a meadow bathed in pale\r\nlight, or a strip of the seashore where the delicate air is impregnated\r\nwith moisture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCIEN PISSARRO.   RUTH (WOODCUT).\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Hacon & Ricketts, the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nTo be at once refined and true is the goal which portrait painting in\r\nrecent years has also specially set itself to reach. In the years of\r\n_chic_ it started with the endeavour to win from every personality its\r\nbeauties, to paint men and women "to advantage"; but later, when the\r\nNaturalism of Bastien-Lepage stood at its zenith, it strove at all costs\r\nto seize the actual human being, to catch, as it were, the work-a-day\r\ncharacter of the personality as it is in involuntary moments when people\r\nbelieve themselves to be unobserved and give up posing. The place of\r\nthose pompous arrangements of the painters of material was taken by a\r\nsoul, and temperament interpreted by an intelligence. And corresponding\r\nwith the universal principle of conceiving man and nature as an\r\nindivisible whole, it became imperative in portrait painting no longer\r\nto place persons before an arbitrary background, but in their real\r\nsurroundings--to paint the man of science in his laboratory, the\r\npainter in his studio, the author at his work-table--and to observe with\r\naccuracy the atmospheric influences of this environment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOUDIN.   THE PORT OF TROUVILLE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nThe ready master-worker of this plain and sincere naturalism in portrait\r\npainting was peculiarly _Fantin-Latour_, who ought not merely to be\r\njudged by his latest paintings, which have something petrified, rigid,\r\ngloomy, and professorial. In his younger days he was a solid and\r\npowerful artist, one of the soundest and simplest of whom France could\r\nboast. His pictures were dark in tone and harmonious, and had a\r\npuritanic charm. The portrait of Manet, and that of the engraver Edwin\r\nEdwards and his wife, in particular, will always preserve their\r\nhistorical value.\r\n\r\nLater, when the whole bias of art tended away from the poorer classes,\r\nand once more approached this fashionable world, portrait painting also\r\nshowed a tendency to become exquisite and over-refined, and to exhibit a\r\npreference for symphonic arrangements of colour and subtilised effects\r\nof light. White, light yellow, and light blue silks were harmonised upon\r\nvery delicate scales with pearly-grey backgrounds. Ladies in mantles of\r\nlight grey fur and rosy dresses stand amid dark-green shrubs, in which\r\nrose-coloured lanterns are burning, or they sit in a ball-dress near a\r\nlamp which produces manifold and tender transformations of light upon\r\nthe white of the silk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  BOLDINI.   GIUSEPPE VERDI.]\r\n\r\nThe work of _Jacques \xc3\x89mile Blanche_, the son of the celebrated\r\nmad-doctor, is peculiarly characteristic of these tendencies of French\r\nportrait painting. It is well known that English fashion was at this\r\ntime regarded in Paris as the height of elegance, while Anglicisms were\r\nentering more and more into the French language; and this tendency of\r\ntaste gave Blanche the occasion for most \xc3\xa6sthetic pictures. The English\r\nMiss, in her attractive mixture of affectation and na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9, in all her\r\nslim and long-footed grace, has found a delicate interpreter in him.\r\nTall ladies clad in white, bitten with the Anglomania, drink tea most\r\n\xc3\xa6sthetically, and sit there bored, or are grouped round the piano;\r\n_gommeux_, neat, straight, _chic_, from their tall hats to their\r\npatent-leather boots, look wearily about the world, with an eyeglass\r\nfixed, a yellow rose in their buttonhole, and a thick stick in the\r\ngloved hand. Amongst his portraits of well-known personalities, much\r\nnotice was attracted by that of his father in 1890--a modern Bertin the\r\nElder, and in 1891 by that of Maurice Barr\xc3\xa8s, a portrait in which he has\r\nanalysed the author of _Le Jardin de B\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9nice_ in a very simple and\r\nconvincing fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Quantin, Paris._\r\n\r\n  WILLETTE.   THE GOLDEN AGE.]\r\n\r\nThe brilliant Italian _Boldini_ brought to this English _chic_ the\r\nmanual volubility of a Southerner: sometimes he was microscopic _\xc3\xa0 la_\r\nMeissonier, sometimes a juggler of the brush _\xc3\xa0 la_ Fortuny, and\r\nsometimes he gave the most seductive mannerism and the most diverting\r\nelegance to his portraits of ladies. Born in 1845, the son of a painter\r\nof saints, Boldini had begun as a Romanticist with pictures for Scott\'s\r\n_Ivanhoe_. From Ferrara he went to Florence, where he remained six\r\nyears. At the end of the sixties he emerged in London, and, after he had\r\npainted Lady Holland and the Duchess of Westminster there, he soon\r\nbecame a popular portrait painter. But since 1872 his home has been\r\nParis, where the fine Anglo-Saxon aroma, the "\xc3\xa6sthetic" originality of\r\nhis pictures, soon became an object of universal admiration. In his\r\nportraits of women Boldini always renders what is most novel. It is as\r\nif he knew in advance the new fashion which the coming season would\r\nbring. His trenchantly cut figures of ladies in white dresses and with\r\nblack gloves have a defiant and insolent effect, and yet one which is\r\ncaptivating through their ultra-modern _chic_. The portraits of Carolus\r\nDuran have nothing of that charm which makes such an appeal to the\r\nnerves, nothing of that discomposing indefinable quality which lies in\r\nthe expression and gestures of a fashionable woman, whose eccentricity\r\nreveals every day fresh _nuances_ of beauty. He had not the faculty of\r\nseizing movement, the most difficult element in the world. But Boldini\'s\r\npictures seem like bold and sudden sketches which clinch the conception\r\nwith spirit and swiftness in liberal, pointed crayon strokes controlled\r\nby keen observation. There is no ornament, no bracelet, no pillars and\r\ndrapery. One hears the silken bodice rustle over the tightly laced\r\ncorset, sees the mobile foot, and the long train swept to the side with\r\na bold movement. Sometimes his creations are full and luxuriant, nude\r\neven in their clothes, excited and full of movement; sometimes they are\r\nbodiless, as if compact of the air, pallid and half-dead with the strain\r\nof nights of festivity, "living with hardly any blood in their veins, in\r\nwhich the pulse beats almost entirely out of complaisance."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORAIN.   AT THE FOLIES-BERG\xc3\x88RES.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of M. Durand-Ruel, the owner of the copyright._)]\r\n\r\nHis pictures of children are just as subtle: there is an elasticity in\r\nthese little girls with their widely opened velvet eyes, their rosy\r\nyoung lips, and their poses calculated with so much coquetry. Boldini\r\nhas an indescribable method of seizing a motion of the head, a mien, or\r\na passing flash of the eyes, of arranging the hair, of indicating\r\ncoquettish lace underclothing beneath bright silk dresses, or of showing\r\nthe grace and fineness of the slender leg of a girl, encased in a black\r\nsilk stocking, and dangling in delicate lines from a light grey sofa.\r\nThere is French _esprit_, something piquant and with a double meaning in\r\nhis art, which borders on the indecorous and is yet charming. These\r\nportraits of ladies, however, form but a small portion of his work. He\r\npaints in oils, in water-colour, and pastel, and is equally marvellous\r\nin handling the portraits of men, the street picture and the landscape.\r\nHis portrait of the painter John Lewis Brown, crossing the street with\r\nhis wife and daughter, looked as though it had been painted in one jet.\r\nIn his little pictures of horses there is an astonishing animation and\r\nnervous energy. M. Faure, the singer, possesses some small _rococo_\r\npictures from his brush, scenes in the Garden of the Tuileries, which\r\nmight have come from Fortuny. His pictures from the street life of\r\nParis--the Place Pigalle, the Place Clichy--recall De Nittis, and some\r\nillustrations--scenes from the great Paris races--might have been drawn\r\nby Caran D\'Ache.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to treat illustration in greater detail, because,\r\nnaturally, it could no longer play the initiative part which fell to it\r\nin earlier days, now that the whole of life had been drawn within the\r\ncompass of pictorial representation. Besides, in an epoch like our own,\r\nwhich is determined to know and see and feel everything, illustration\r\nhas been so extended that it would be quite impossible even to select\r\nthe most important work. Entirely apart from the many painters who\r\noccasionally illustrated novels or other books, such as Bastien-Lepage,\r\nGervex, Dantan, D\xc3\xa9taille, Dagnan-Bouveret, Ribot, Benjamin Constant,\r\nJean Paul Laurens, and others, there are a number of professional\r\ndraughtsmen in Paris, most of whom are really distinguished artists.\r\n\r\nIn particular, _Ch\xc3\xa9ret_, one of the most original artists of our\r\ntime--Ch\xc3\xa9ret, the great king of posters, the monarch of a fabulously\r\ncharming world, in which everything gleams in blue and red and orange,\r\ncannot be passed over in a history of painting. The flowers which he\r\ncarelessly strews on all sides with his spendthrift hand are not\r\ndestined for preservation in an historical herbarium; his works are\r\ntransient flashes of spirit, brilliantly shining, ephemera, but a bold\r\nand subtle Parisian art is concealed amid this improvisation. Settled\r\nfor many years in London, Jules Ch\xc3\xa9ret had there already drawn admirable\r\nplacards, which are now much sought after by collectors.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 he introduced this novel branch of industry into France, and\r\ngave it--thanks to the invention of machines which admit of the\r\nemployment of the largest lithographic stones--an artistic development\r\nwhich could not have been anticipated. He has created many thousands of\r\nposters. The book-trade, the great shops, and almost all branches of\r\nindustry owe their success to him. His theatrical posters alone are\r\namongst the most graceful products of modern art: La F\xc3\xaate des Mitrons,\r\nLa Salle de Frascati, Les Mongolis, Le Chat Bott\xc3\xa9, L\'Ath\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9e Comique,\r\nFantaisies Music-Hall, La F\xc3\xa9e Cocotte, Les Tsiganes, Les Folies-Berg\xc3\xa8res\r\nen Voyage, Spectacle Concert de l\'Horloge, Skating Rink, Les Pillules du\r\nDiable, La Chatte Blanche, Le Petit Faust, La Vie Parisienne, Le Droit\r\ndu Seigneur, Cendrillon, Orph\xc3\xa9e aux Enfers, \xc3\x89den Th\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa2tre, etc. These are\r\nmere posters, destined to hang for a few days at the street corners, and\r\nyet in graceful ease, sparkling life, and coquettish bloom of colour\r\nthey surpass many oil paintings which flaunt upon the walls of the Mus\xc3\xa9e\r\nLuxembourg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  CAZIN.   JUDITH.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the illustrators _Willette_ is perhaps the most charming, the\r\nmost brilliant in grace, fancy, and spirit. A drawing by him is\r\nsomething living, light, and fresh. Only amongst the Japanese, or the\r\ngreat draughtsmen of the _rococo_ period, does one find plates of a\r\ncharm similar to Willette\'s tender poems of the "Chevalier Printemps" or\r\nthe "Baiser de la Rose." At the same time there is something curiously\r\ninnocent, something primitive, na\xc3\xafve, something like the song of a bird,\r\nin his charming art. No one can laugh with such youthful freshness. No\r\none has such a childlike fancy. Willette possesses the curious gift of\r\nlooking at the world like a boy of sixteen with eyes that are not jaded\r\nfor all the beauty of things, with the eyes of a schoolboy in love for\r\nthe first time. He has drawn angels for Gothic windows, battles, and\r\neverything imaginable; nevertheless, woman is supreme over his whole\r\nwork, ruined and pure as an angel, cursed and adored, and yet always\r\nenchanting. She is Manon Lescaut, with her soft eyes and angelically\r\npure sins. She has something of the lovely piquancy of the woman of\r\nBrant\xc3\xb4me, when she disdainfully laughs out of countenance poor Pierrot,\r\nwho sings his serenades to her plaintively in the moonlight. One might\r\nsay that Willette is himself his Pierrot, dazzled with the young bosoms\r\nand rosy lips: at one time graceful and laughing, wild as a young fellow\r\nwho has just escaped from school; at another earnest and angry, like an\r\narchangel driving away the sinful; to-day fiery, and to-morrow\r\nmelancholy; now in love, teasing, blithe, and tender, now gloomy and in\r\nmortal trouble. He laughs amid tears and weeps amid laughter, singing\r\nthe _Dies Ir\xc3\xa6_ after a couplet of Offenbach; himself wears a\r\nblack-and-white garment, and is, at the same time, mystic and sensuous.\r\nHis plates are as exhilarating as sparkling champagne, and breathe the\r\nsoft, plaintive spirit of old ballads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Baschet._\r\n\r\n  CAZIN.   HAGAR AND ISHMAEL.]\r\n\r\nBeside this amiable Pierrot _Forain_ is like the modern Satyr, the true\r\noutcome of the Goncourts and Gavarni, the product of the most modern\r\ndecadence. All the vice and grace of Paris, all the luxury of the world,\r\nand all the _chic_ of the _demi-monde_ he has drawn with spirit, with\r\nbold stenographical execution, and the elegance of a sure-handed expert.\r\nEvery stroke is made with trenchant energy and ultimate grace. Adultery,\r\ngambling, _chambres s\xc3\xa9par\xc3\xa9es_, carriages, horses, villas in the Bois de\r\nBoulogne; and then the reverse side--degradation, theft, hunger, the\r\nfilth of the streets, pistols, suicide,--such are the principal stages\r\nof the modern epic which Forain composed; and over all the _Parisienne_,\r\nthe dancing-girl, floats with smiling grace like a breath of beauty. His\r\nchief field of study is the promenade of the Folies-Berg\xc3\xa8res--the\r\ndelicate profiles of an\xc3\xa6mic girls singing, the heavy masses of flesh of\r\ngluttonising _gourmets_, the impudent laughter and lifeless eyes of\r\nprostitutes, the thin waists, lean arms, and demon hips of fading bodies\r\nlaced in silk. Little dancing-girls and fat _rou\xc3\xa9s_, snobs with short,\r\nwide overcoats, huge collars, and long, pointed shoes--they all move,\r\nlive, and exhale the odour of their own peculiar atmosphere. There is\r\nspirit in the line of an overcoat which Forain draws, in the furniture\r\nof a room, in the hang of a fur or a silk dress. He is the master of the\r\nlight, fleeting seizure of the definitive line. Every one of his plates\r\nis like a spirited _causerie_, which is to be understood through nods\r\nand winks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARRI\xc3\x88RE.   MOTHERHOOD.]\r\n\r\nThe name of _Paul Renouard_ is inseparable from the opera. Degas had\r\nalready painted the opera and the ballet-dancers with wonderful reality,\r\nfine irony, or in the weird humour of a dance of death. But Renouard did\r\nnot imitate Degas. As a pupil of Pils he was one of the many who, in\r\n1871, were occupied with the decoration of the staircase of the new\r\nopera house, and through this opportunity he obtained his first glance\r\ninto this capricious and mysterious world made up of contrasts,--a world\r\nwhich henceforward became his domain. All his ballet-dancers are\r\naccurately drawn at their rehearsals, but the charm of their smile, of\r\ntheir figures, their silk tights, their gracious movements, has\r\nsomething which almost goes beyond nature. Renouard is a realist with\r\nvery great taste. Girls practising at standing on the tips of their\r\ntoes, dancing, curtseying, and throwing kisses to the audience are\r\nbroadly and surely drawn with a few strokes. The opera is for him a\r\nuniverse in a nutshell--a _r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9_ of Paris, where all the oddities, all\r\nthe wildness, and all the sadness of modern life are to be found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  BESNARD.   EVENING.]\r\n\r\nMention must also be made of _Daniel Vierge_, torn prematurely from his\r\nart by a cruel disease, but not before he had been able to complete his\r\nmasterpiece, the edition of Don Pablo de Segovia. _Henri de\r\nToulouse-Lautrec_ too must be named, the grim historian of absinthe\r\ndens, music halls and dancing saloons; and we must give a passing glance\r\nto _L\xc3\xa9andre_ and _Steinlen_, in whose drawings also the whole of\r\nParisian life breathes and pulsates, with all the glitter of\r\nover-civilisation, with all its ultra-refinement of pleasure. But a\r\ndetailed appreciation of these draughtsmen is obviously out of place in\r\na history of painting.\r\n\r\nIf we turn back to those who have done good work in the province of\r\npainting pure and simple, we must tarry for a while with that refined\r\npainter of elegiac landscape, _Charles Cazin_. He awaits us as the\r\nevening gathers, and tells with a vibrating voice of things which induce\r\na mood of gentle melancholy. He has his own hour, his own world, his own\r\nmen and women. His hour is that secret and mystic time when the sun has\r\ngone down and the moon is rising, when soft shadows repose upon the\r\nearth and bring forgetfulness. The land he enters is a damp, misty land\r\nwith dunes and pale foliage, one that lies beneath a heavy sky and is\r\nseldom irradiated by a beam of hope, a land of Lethe and oblivion of\r\nself, a land created to yield to the tender colour of infinite\r\nweariness. The motives of his landscapes are always exceedingly simple,\r\nthough they have a simplicity which is perhaps forced, instead of being\r\nentirely na\xc3\xafve. He represents, it may be, the entrance into a village\r\nwith a few cottages, a few thin poplars, and reddish tiled roofs, bathed\r\nin the pale shadows of evening. Upon the broad street lined with\r\nirregular houses, in a provincial town, the rain comes splashing down.\r\nOr it is night, and in the sky there are black clouds, with the moon\r\nsoftly peering between them. Lamps are gleaming in the windows of the\r\nhouses, and an old post-chaise rolling heavily over the slippery\r\npavement. Or dun-green shadows repose upon a solitary green field with a\r\nwindmill and a sluggish stream. The earth is wrapt in mysterious\r\nsilence, and there is movement only in the sky, where a flash of\r\nlightning quivers--not one that blazes into intensely vivid light, but\r\nrather a silvery white electric spark lambent in the dark firmament.\r\nCorot alone has painted such things, but where he is joyous Cazin is\r\nelegiac. The little solitary houses are of a ghostly grey. The trees\r\nsway towards each other as if in tremulous fear. And the mist hangs damp\r\nin the brown boughs. Faint evening shadows flit around. A Northern\r\nmalaria seems to prevail. At times a sea-bird utters a wailing\r\ncomplaint. One thinks of Russian novels, Nihilism, and Raskolnikoff,\r\nthough I know not through what association of ideas. One is disposed to\r\nsit by the wayside and dream, as Verlaine sings:--\r\n\r\n  "La lune blanche\r\n   Luit dans les bois;\r\n   De chaque branche\r\n   Part une voix.\r\n   L\'\xc3\xa9tang refl\xc3\xa8te,\r\n   Profond miroir,\r\n   La silhouette\r\n   Du saule noir\r\n   O\xc3\xb9 le vent pleure:\r\n   R\xc3\xaavons c\'est l\'heure.\r\n   Un vaste et tendre\r\n   Apaisement\r\n   Semble descendre\r\n   Du firmament\r\n   Que l\'astre irise:\r\n   C\'est l\'heure exquise."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  BESNARD.   PORTRAIT OF MLLES. D.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the humour of the landscape is associated with the memory of\r\nkindred feelings which passages in the Bible or in old legends have\r\nawakened in him. In such cases he creates the biblical or mythological\r\npictures which have principally occupied him in recent years. Grey-green\r\ndusk rests upon the earth; the shadows of evening drive away the last\r\nrays of the sun. A mother with her child is sitting upon a bundle of\r\nstraw in front of a thatched cottage with a ladder leaning against its\r\nroof, and a poverty-stricken yard bordered by an old paling, while a man\r\nin a brown mantle stands beside her, leaning upon a stick: this picture\r\nis "The Birth of Christ." Two solitary people, a man and a woman, are\r\nwalking through a soft, undulating country. The sun is sinking. No house\r\nwill give the weary wanderers shelter in the night, but the shade of\r\nevening, which is gradually descending, envelops them with its\r\nmelancholy peace: this is "The Flight into Egypt." An arid waste of\r\nsand, with a meagre bush rising here and there, and the parching summer\r\nsun brooding sultry overhead, forms the landscape of the picture "Hagar\r\nand Ishmael." Or the fortifications of a medi\xc3\xa6val town are represented.\r\nNight is drawing on, watch-fires are burning, brawny figures stand at\r\nthe anvil fashioning weapons, and the sentinels pace gravely along the\r\nmoat. The besieged town is Bethulia, and the woman who issues with a\r\nwild glance from the town gateway is Judith, going forth followed by her\r\nhandmaid to slay Holofernes. Through such works Cazin has become the\r\ncreator of the landscape of religious sentiment, which has since\r\noccupied so much space in French and German painting. The costume\r\nbelongs to no time in particular, though it is almost more appropriate\r\nto the present than to bygone ages; but something so biblical, so\r\npatriarchal, such a remote and mystical poetry is expressed in the great\r\nlines of the landscape that the figures seem like visions from a far-off\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe continuation of this movement is marked by that charming artist who\r\ndelighted in mystery, _Eug\xc3\xa8ne Carri\xc3\xa8re_, "the modern painter of\r\nMadonnas," as he has been called by Edmond de Goncourt. Probably no one\r\nbefore him has painted the unconscious spiritual life of children with\r\nthe same tender, absorbed feeling: little hands grasping at something,\r\nstammering lips of little ones who would kiss their mother, dreamy eyes\r\ngazing into infinity. But although young children at the beginning of\r\nlife, whose eyes open wide as they turn towards the future, look out of\r\nhis pictures, a profound sadness rests over them. His figures move\r\ngravely and silently in a soft, mysterious dusk, as though divided from\r\nthe world of realities by a veil of gauze. All forms seem to melt, and\r\nfading flowers shed a sleepy fragrance around; it is as though there\r\nwere bats flitting invisible through the air. Even as a portrait painter\r\nhe is still a poet dreaming in eternal haze and a twilight of mystery.\r\nIn his portraits, Alphonse Daudet, Geffroy, Dolent, and Edmond de\r\nGoncourt looked as though they had been resolved into vapour, although\r\nthe delineation of character was of astonishing power, and marked firmly\r\nwith a penetrative insight into spiritual life such as was shared by\r\nRibot alone.\r\n\r\nAt the very opposite pole of art stands _Paul Albert Besnard_: amongst\r\nthe worshippers of light he is, perhaps, the most subtle and forcible\r\npoet, a luminist who cannot find tones high enough when he would play\r\nupon the fibres of the spirit. Having issued from the \xc3\x89cole des\r\nBeaux-Arts, and gained the _Prix de Rome_ with a work which attracted\r\nmuch notice, he had long moved upon strictly official lines; and he only\r\nbroke from his academical strait-waistcoat about a dozen years ago, to\r\nbecome the refined artist to whom the younger generation do honour in\r\nthese days, a seeker whose works vary widely in point of merit, though\r\nthey always strike one afresh from the bold confidence with which he\r\nattacks and solves the most difficult problems of light. In Puvis de\r\nChavannes, Cazin, and Carri\xc3\xa8re a reaction towards sombre effect and\r\npale, vaporous beauty of tone followed the brightness of Manet; but\r\nBesnard, pushing forward upon Manet\'s course, revels in the most subtle\r\neffects of illumination--effects not ventured upon even by the boldest\r\nImpressionists--endeavours to arrest the most unexpected and unforeseen\r\nphases of light, and the most hazardous combinations of colour. The\r\nruddy glow of the fire glances upon faded flowers. Chandeliers and\r\ntapers outshine the soft radiance of the lamp; artificial light\r\nstruggles with the sudden burst of daylight; and lanterns, standing out\r\nagainst the night sky like golden lights with a purple border, send\r\ntheir glistening rays into the blue gloom. It is only in the field of\r\nliterature that a parallel may be found in Jens Pieter Jacobsen, who in\r\nhis novels occasionally describes with a similar finesse of perception\r\nthe reflection of fire upon gold and silver, upon silk and satin, upon\r\nred and yellow and blue, or enumerates the hundred tints in which the\r\nSeptember sun pours into a room.\r\n\r\nThe portrait group of his children is a harmony in red. A boy and two\r\ngirls are standing, with the most delightful absence of all constraint,\r\nin a country room, which looks out upon a mountainous landscape. The\r\nwall of the background is red, and red the costume of the little ones,\r\nyet all these conflicting _nuances_ of red tones are brought into\r\nharmonious unity with inherent taste. Rubens would have rejoiced over a\r\nsecond landscape exhibited in the same year. A nude woman is seated upon\r\na divan drinking tea, with her feet tucked under her and her back to the\r\nspectator. Upon her back are cast the warm and the more subdued\r\nreflections of a fire which lies out of sight and of the daylight\r\nquivering in yellowish stripes, like a glowing aureole upon her soft\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Studio._\r\n\r\n  AMAN-JEAN.   SOUS LA GUERLANDA.]\r\n\r\nIn a third picture, called "Vision de Femme," a young woman with the\r\nupper part of her form unclothed appears upon a terrace, surrounded by\r\nred blooming flowers and the glowing yellow light of the moon. Under\r\nthis symbol Besnard imagined Lutetia, the eternally young, hovering over\r\nthe rhododendrons of the Champs Elys\xc3\xa9es and looking down upon the blaze\r\nof lights in the Caf\xc3\xa9 des Ambassadeurs. In 1889 he produced "The Siren,"\r\na symphony in red. A _petite femme_ of Montmartre stands wearily in a\r\nhalf-antique morning toilette before a billowing lake, which glows\r\nbeneath the rays of the setting sun in fiery red and dull mallow colour.\r\nIn his "Autumn" of 1890 he made the same experiment in green. The moon\r\ncasts its silvery light upon the changeful greenish mirror of a lake,\r\nand at the same time plays in a thousand reflections upon the green silk\r\ndress of a lady sitting upon the shore; while, in a picture of 1891, a\r\nyoung lady in an elegant _n\xc3\xa9glig\xc3\xa9_ is seated at the piano, with her\r\nhusband beside her turning over the music. The light of the candles is\r\nshed over hands, faces, and clothes. Another picture, called "Clouds of\r\nEvening," represented a woman with delicate profile amid a violet\r\nlandscape over which the clouds were lightly hovering, touched with\r\norange-red by the setting sun. The double portrait, executed in 1892, of\r\nthe "Mlles. D----," one of whom is leisurely placing a scarf over her\r\nshoulders with a movement almost recalling Leighton, while the other\r\nstoops to pick a blossom from a rhododendron bush, is exceedingly soft\r\nin its green, red, and blue harmony.\r\n\r\nThe French Government recognised the eminent decorative talent displayed\r\nin these pictures, and gave Besnard the opportunity of achieving further\r\ntriumphs as a mural painter. Here, too, he is modern to his fingertips,\r\nknowing nothing of stately gestures, nothing of old-world na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9; but\r\nmerely through his appetising and sparkling play of colour he has the\r\nart of converting great blank spaces into a marvellous storied realm.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 he had to represent "Astronomy" as a ceiling-piece for the Salon\r\ndes Sciences in the H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville. Ten years before there would have\r\nbeen no artist who would not have executed this task by the introduction\r\nof nude figures provided with instructive attributes. One would have\r\nheld a globe, the second a pair of compasses, and the third a telescope\r\nin one hand, and in the other branches of laurel wherewith to crown\r\nGalileo, Columbus, or Kepler. Besnard made a clean sweep of all this. He\r\ndid not forget that a ceiling is a kind of sky, and accordingly he\r\npainted the planets themselves, the stars which run their course through\r\nthe firmament of blue. The figures of the constellations are arranged in\r\na gracious interplay of light bodies floating softly past. Amongst the\r\npictures of the \xc3\x89cole de Pharmacie a like effect is produced by\r\nBesnard\'s great composition "Evening," a work treated with august\r\nsimplicity. The atmosphere is of a grey-bluish white: stars are\r\nglittering here and there, and two very ancient beings, a man and a\r\nwoman, sit upon the threshold of their house, grave, weather-beaten\r\nforms of quiet grandeur, executed with expressive lines. The old man\r\ncasts a searching glance at the stars, as if yearning after immortality,\r\nwhile the woman leans weary and yet contented upon his shoulder. In the\r\nroom behind a kettle hangs bubbling over the fire, and a young woman\r\nwith a child upon her arm steps through the door: man and the starry\r\nworld, the finite and the infinite, presented under plain symbols.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARRI\xc3\x88RE.   SCHOOLWORK.]\r\n\r\nSuch are, more or less, the representative minds of contemporary France,\r\nthe centres from which other minds issue like rays. _Alfred Agache_\r\ndevotes himself with great dexterity to an allegorical style after the\r\nfashion of Barroccio. Inspired by the pre-Raphaelites, _Aman-Jean_ has\r\nfound the model for his allegorical compositions in Botticelli, and is a\r\nneurasthenic in colour, which is exceptionally striking, in his delicate\r\nportraits of women. _Maurice Denis_, who drew the illustrations to\r\nVerlaine\'s _Sagesse_ in a style full of archaic bloom, as a painter\r\ntakes delight in the intoxicating fragrance of incense, the gliding\r\nsteps and slow, quiet movements of nuns, in men and women kneeling\r\nbefore the altar in prayer, and priests crossing themselves before the\r\ngolden statue of the Virgin. The Spaniard _Gandara_, who lives in Paris,\r\ndisplays in his grey and melting portraits much feeling for the\r\ndecorative swing of lines. That spirited "pointillist" _Henri Martin_\r\nseems for the present to have reached a climax in his "Cain and Abel,"\r\none of the most powerful creations of the younger generation in France.\r\n_Louis Picard\'s_ work has a tincture of literature, and he delights in\r\nEdgar Allan Poe, mysticism and psychology. _Ary Renan_, the son of\r\nErnest Renan and the grandson of Ary Scheffer, has given the soft\r\nsubdued tones of Puvis de Chavannes a tender Anglo-Saxon fragrance in\r\nthe manner of Walter Crane. And that spirited artist in lithograph,\r\n_Odilon Redon_, has visions of distorted faces, flowers that no mortal\r\neye has seen, and huge white sea-birds screaming as they fly across a\r\nblack world. Forebodings like those we read of in the verse of Poe take\r\nshape in his works, ghosts roam in the broad daylight, and the sea-green\r\neyes of Medusa-heads dripping with blood shine in the darkness of night\r\nwith a mesmeric effect. _Carlos Schwabe_ drew the illustrations for the\r\n_\xc3\x89vangile de l\'Enfance_ of Catulle Mend\xc3\xa8s with the charming na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 of\r\nHans Memlinc, and afterwards attracted attention by his delicate,\r\narchaic pictures.\r\n\r\n_Bonnard_, _Vuillard_, _Valloton_ and _Roussel_ are others whose names\r\nhave in the last few years become well known. Their art is built up on\r\nthe foundation laid by the Impressionists only so far as they use the\r\nnew colour-values discovered by the "bright painters," in a free,\r\nharmonious manner, and place them at the service of a new decorative\r\npurpose. In exhibitions one is often at a loss how to view these\r\ndecorative paintings, such, for instance, as those of Bonnard and\r\nVuillard; the eye is astounded for a moment when, after looking at the\r\nusual array of good pictures, it suddenly comes upon works that look\r\nmore like pieces of Gobelin tapestry than paintings. Then one\'s mind\r\nreverts to rooms such as Olbrich, Van de Velde, or Josef Hoffmann\r\ndesigned with some particular purpose in view, and one understands the\r\nobject of these pictures. "We can hang in our rooms any picture which is\r\nbeautiful in itself and by itself." That is the old familiar story, but\r\nthat feeling never enters our minds when we stand in a medi\xc3\xa6val room in\r\nwhich there are no pictures that can be taken away from their\r\nsurroundings. It is a difficult task to arrange things that are\r\nindividually beautiful into a harmonious whole. The realisation of the\r\nold-time principle is for obvious reasons well-nigh impracticable--the\r\nmodern man is a restless, fickle creature; he must always be at liberty\r\nto pitch his tent anywhere--but we can surely make some approach to it.\r\nOne may imagine in every dwelling a room in which furniture and pictures\r\nare made to fit into some conception of harmony, and the works of\r\nBonnard and Vuillard may be conceived as parts of such a scheme for the\r\ndecoration of a room, and indeed--though we must not forget similar\r\nattempts which have been made in other directions--as parts of a scheme\r\nwhich, though thoroughly modern and by no means a mere external copy,\r\nreverts to the style of bygone centuries.\r\n\r\nFrom the historian\'s standpoint these young artists scarcely come into\r\nquestion; they are still too much in the embryonic stage for any\r\nconclusion to be arrived at with respect to either of them. But the art\r\nlover who looks to the future rather than the past feels bound to follow\r\nwith care their creations, in which the wealth of beauty that is already\r\nindicated in their first prints, the certainty of purpose with which\r\nthey direct their efforts towards the point at which Impressionism has\r\nleft the widest gap, seems to give a guarantee that in the future France\r\nwill maintain in the province of art the position she has held during\r\nthe nineteenth century as the leading artistic nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nSPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as France to-day shows such a wealth of talent, Spain,\r\ncorrespondingly, can scarcely be said to come into the question of\r\nmodern endeavour in art; in fact, it is quite impossible to treat of a\r\nhistory of Spanish art, one can only consider individual artists, for\r\nthey each go their own way, working in different directions and without\r\nany concerted plan.\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of 1870 that a little picture called "La Vicaria"\r\nwas exhibited in Paris at the dealer Goupil\'s. A marriage is taking\r\nplace in the sacristy of a _rococo_ church in Madrid. The walls are\r\ncovered with faded Cordova leather hangings figured in gold and dull\r\ncolours, and a magnificent _rococo_ screen separates the sacristy from\r\nthe middle aisle. Venetian lustres are suspended from the ceiling;\r\npictures of martyrs, Venetian glasses in carved oval frames hang on the\r\nwall, richly ornamented wooden benches, and a library of missals and\r\ngospels in sparkling silver clasps, and shining marble tables and\r\nglistening braziers form part of the scene in which the marriage\r\ncontract is being signed. The costumes are those of the time of Goya. As\r\na matter of fact, an old beau is marrying a young and beautiful girl.\r\nWith affected grace and a skipping minuet step, holding a modish\r\nthree-cornered hat under his arm, he approaches the table to put his\r\nsignature in the place which the _escribano_ points out with an\r\nobsequious bow. He is arrayed in delicate lilac, while the bride is\r\nwearing a white silk dress trimmed with flowered lace, and has a wreath\r\nof orange blossoms in her luxuriant black hair. As a girl-friend is\r\ntalking to her she examines with abstracted attention the pretty little\r\npictures upon her fan, the finest she has ever possessed. A very piquant\r\nlittle head she has, with her long lashes and her black eyes. Then, in\r\nthe background, follow the witnesses, and first of all a young lady in a\r\nswelling silk dress of the brightest rose-colour. Beside her is one of\r\nthe bridegroom\'s friends in a cabbage-green coat with long flaps, and a\r\nshining belt from which a gleaming sabre hangs. The whole picture is a\r\nmarvellous assemblage of colours, in which tones of Venetian glow and\r\nstrength, the tender pearly grey beloved of the Japanese, and a melting\r\nneutral brown, each sets off the other and give a shimmering effect to\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nThe painter, who was barely thirty, bore the name of _Mariano Fortuny_,\r\nand was born in Reus, a little town in the province of Tarragona, on\r\n11th June 1838. Five years after he had completed this work he died, at\r\nthe age of thirty-six, on 21st November 1874. Short as his career was,\r\nit was, nevertheless, so brilliant, his success so immense, his\r\ninfluence so great, that his place in the history of modern painting\r\nremains assured to him.\r\n\r\nLike French art, Spanish art, after Goya\'s death, had borne the yoke of\r\nClassicism, Romanticism, and academical influence by turns. In the grave\r\nof Goya there was buried for ever, as it seemed, the world of torreros,\r\nmajas, manolas, monks, smugglers, knaves, and witches, and all the local\r\ncolour of the Spanish Peninsula. As late as the Paris World Exhibition\r\nof 1867, Spain was merely represented by a few carefully composed, and\r\njust as carefully painted, but tame and tedious, historical pictures of\r\nthe David or the Delaroche stamp--works such as had been painted for\r\nwhole decades by Jos\xc3\xa9 Madrazo, J. Ribera y Fernandez, Federigo Madrazo,\r\nCarlo Luis Ribera, Eduardo Rosales, and many others whose names there is\r\nno reason for rescuing from oblivion. They laboured, meditating an art\r\nwhich was not their own, and could not waken any echo in themselves.\r\nTheir painting was body without soul, empty histrionic skill. As\r\ncomplete darkness had rested for a century over Spanish art, from the\r\ndeath of Claudio Coellos in 1693 to the appearance of Goya, rising like\r\na meteor, so the first half of the nineteenth century produced no single\r\noriginal artist until Fortuny came forward in the sixties.\r\n\r\nHe grew up amid poor surroundings, and when he was twelve years of age\r\nhe lost his father and mother. His grandfather, an enterprising and\r\nadventurous joiner, had made for himself a cabinet of wax figures, which\r\nhe exhibited from town to town in the province of Tarragona. With his\r\ngrandson he went on foot through all the towns of Catalonia, the old man\r\nshowing the wax figures which the boy had painted. Whenever he had a\r\nmoment free the latter was drawing, carving in wood, or modelling in\r\nwax. It chanced, however, that a sculptor saw his attempts, spoke of\r\nthem in Fortuny\'s birthplace, and succeeded in inducing the town to make\r\nan allowance of forty-two francs a month to a lad whose talent had so\r\nmuch promise. By these means Fortuny was enabled to attend the Academy\r\nof Barcelona for four years. In 1857, when he was nineteen years of age,\r\nhe received the _Prix de Rome_, and set out for Rome itself in the same\r\nyear. But whilst he was copying the pictures of the old masters there a\r\ncircumstance occurred which set him upon another course. The war between\r\nSpain and the Emperor of Morocco determined his future career. Fortuny\r\nwas then a young man of three-and-twenty, very strong, rather thick-set,\r\nquick to resent an injury, taciturn, resolute, and accustomed to hard\r\nwork. His residence in the East, which lasted from five to six months,\r\nwas a discovery for him--a feast of delight. He found the opportunity of\r\nstudying in the immediate neighbourhood a people whose life was opulent\r\nin colour and wild in movement; and he beheld with wonder the gleaming\r\npictorial episodes so variously enacted before him, and the rich\r\ncostumes upon which the radiance of the South glanced in a hundred\r\nreflections. And, in particular, when the Emperor of Morocco came with\r\nhis brilliant suite to sign the treaty of peace, Fortuny developed a\r\nfeverish activity. The great battle-piece which he should have executed\r\non the commission of the Academy of Barcelona remained unfinished. On\r\nthe other hand, he painted a series of Oriental pictures, in which his\r\nastonishing dexterity and his marvellously sensitive eye were already to\r\nbe clearly discerned: the stalls of Moorish carpet-sellers, with little\r\nfigures swarming about them, and the rich display of woven stuffs of the\r\nEast; the weary attitude of old Arabs sitting in the sun; the sombre,\r\nbrooding faces of strange snake-charmers and magicians. This is no\r\nParisian East, like Fromentin\'s; every one here speaks Arabic.\r\nGuillaumet alone, who afterwards interpreted the fakir world of the\r\nEast, dreamy and contemplative in the sunshine, has been equally\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._   MARIANO FORTUNY.]\r\n\r\nYet Fortuny first discovered his peculiar province when he began, after\r\nhis return, to paint those brilliant kaleidoscopic _rococo_ pictures\r\nwith their charming play of colour, the pictures which founded his\r\nreputation in Paris. Even in the earliest, representing gentlemen of the\r\n_rococo_ period examining engravings in a richly appointed interior, the\r\nJapanese weapons, Renaissance chests, gilded frames of carved wood, and\r\nall the delightful _petit-riens_ from the treasury of the past which he\r\nhad heaped together in it, were so wonderfully painted that Goupil began\r\na connection with him and ordered further works. This commission\r\noccasioned his journey, in the autumn of 1866, to Paris, where he\r\nentered into Meissonier\'s circle, and worked sometimes at G\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me\'s. Yet\r\nneither of them exerted any influence upon him at all worth mentioning.\r\nThe French painter in miniature is probably the father of the department\r\nof art to which Fortuny belongs; but the latter united to the delicate\r\nexecution of the Frenchman the flashing, gleaming spirit of the Latin\r\nraces of the South. He is a Meissonier with _esprit_ recalling Goya. In\r\nhis picture "The Spanish Marriage" (La Vicaria) all the vivid,\r\nthrobbing, _rococo_ world, buried with Goya, revived once more. While in\r\nhis Oriental pieces--"The Praying Arab," "The Arabian Fantasia," and\r\n"The Snake Charmers"--he still aimed at concentration and unity of\r\neffect, this picture had something gleaming, iridescent and pearly,\r\nwhich soon became the delight of all collectors. Fortuny\'s successes,\r\nhis celebrity, and his fortune dated from that time. His fame flashed\r\nforth like a meteor. After fighting long years in vain, not for\r\nrecognition, but for his very bread, he suddenly became the most honored\r\npainter of the day, and began to exert upon a whole generation of young\r\nartists that powerful influence which survives even at this very day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORTUNY.   THE SPANISH MARRIAGE (LA VICARIA).\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Goupil & Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nThe studio which he built for himself after his marriage with the\r\ndaughter of Federigo Madrazo in Rome was a little museum of the most\r\nexquisite products of the artistic crafts of the West and the East: the\r\nwalls were decorated with brilliant oriental stuffs, and great glass\r\ncabinets with Moorish and Arabian weapons, and old tankards and glasses\r\nfrom Murano stood around. He sought and collected everything that shines\r\nand gleams in varying colour. That was his world, and the basis of his\r\nart.\r\n\r\nPillars of marble and porphyry, groups of ivory and bronze, lustres of\r\nVenetian glass, gilded consoles with small busts, great tables supported\r\nby gilded satyrs and inlaid with variegated mosaics, form the\r\nsurroundings of that astonishing work "The Trial of the Model." Upon a\r\nmarble table a young girl is standing naked, posing before a row of\r\nacademicians in the costume of the Louis XV period, while each one of\r\nthem gives his judgment by a movement or an expression of the face. One\r\nof them has approached quite close, and is examining the little woman\r\nthrough his lorgnette. All the costumes gleam in a thousand hues, which\r\nthe marble reflects. By his picture "The Poet" or "The Rehearsal" he\r\nreached his highest point in the capricious analysis of light. In an old\r\n_rococo_ garden, with the brilliant fa\xc3\xa7ade of the Alhambra as its\r\nbackground, there is a gathering of gentlemen assembled to witness the\r\nrehearsal of a tragedy. The heroine, a tall, charming, luxuriant beauty,\r\nhas just fallen into a faint. On the other hand, the hero, holding the\r\nlady on his right arm, is reading the verses of his part from a large\r\nmanuscript. The gentlemen are listening, and exchanging remarks with the\r\nair of connoisseurs; one of them closes his eyes to listen with thorough\r\nattention. Here the entire painting flashes like a rocket, and is as\r\niridescent and brilliant as a peacock\'s tail. Fortuny splits the rays of\r\nthe sun into endless _nuances_ which are scarcely perceptible to the\r\neye, and gives expression to their flashing glitter with astonishing\r\ndelicacy. Henri Regnault, who visited him at that time in Rome, wrote to\r\na Parisian friend: "The time I spent with Fortuny yesterday is haunting\r\nme still. What a magnificent fellow he is! He paints the most marvellous\r\nthings, and is the master of us all. I wish I could show you the two or\r\nthree pictures that he has in hand, or his etchings and water-colours.\r\nThey inspired me with a real disgust of my own. Ah! Fortuny, you spoil\r\nmy sleep."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORTUNY.   THE TRIAL OF THE MODEL.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Boussod, Valadon & Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nEven as an etcher he caught all the technical finesses and appetising\r\npiquancies of his great forerunner Goya. It is only with very light and\r\nspirited strokes that the outlines of his figures are drawn; then, as in\r\nGoya, comes the aquatint, the colour which covers the background and\r\ngives locality, depth, and light. A few scratches with a needle, a black\r\nspot, a light made by a judiciously inserted patch of white, and he\r\ngives his figures life and character, causing them to emerge from the\r\nblack depth of the background like mysterious visions. "The Dead Arab,"\r\ncovered with his black cloak, and lying on the ground with his musket on\r\nhis arm, "The Shepherd" on the stump of a pillar, "The Serenade," "The\r\nReader," "The Tambourine Player," "The Pensioner," the picture of the\r\ngentleman with a pig-tail bending over his flowers, "The Anchorite," and\r\n"The Arab mourning over the Body of his Friend," are the most important\r\nof his plates, which are sometimes pungent and spirited, and sometimes\r\nsombre and fantastic.\r\n\r\nIn the picture "The Strand of Portici" he attempted to strike out a new\r\npath. He was tired of the gay rags of the eighteenth century, as he said\r\nhimself, and meant to paint for the future only subjects from\r\nsurrounding life in an entirely modern manner like that of Manet. But he\r\nwas not destined to carry out this change any further. He passed away in\r\nRome on 21st November 1874. When the unsold works which he left were put\r\nup to auction the smallest sketches fetched high figures, and even his\r\netchings were bought at marvellous prices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gaz. des Beaux-Arts._\r\n\r\n  FORTUNY.   THE SNAKE CHARMERS.]\r\n\r\nIn these days the enthusiasm for Fortuny is no longer so glowing. The\r\ncapacity to paint became so ordinary in the course of years that it was\r\npresupposed as a matter of course; it was a necessary acquirement for an\r\nartist to have before approaching his pictures in a psychological\r\nfashion. And in this later respect there is a deficiency in Fortuny. He\r\nis a _charmeur_ who dazzles the eyes, but rather creates a sense of\r\nastonishment than holds the spectator in his grip. Beneath his hands\r\npainting has become a matter of pure virtuosity, a marvellous, flaring\r\nfirework that amazes and--leaves us cold after all. With enchanting\r\ndelicacy he runs through the brilliant gamut of radiant colours upon the\r\nsmall keyboard of his little pictures painted with a pocket-lens, and\r\neverything glitters golden, like the dress of a fairy. He united to the\r\npatience of Meissonier a delicacy of colour, a wealth of pictorial\r\npoint, and a crowd of delightful trifles, which combine to make him a\r\nmost exquisite and fascinating juggler of the palette--an amazing\r\ncolourist, a wonderful clown, an original and subtle painter with\r\nvibrating nerves, but not a truly great and moving artist. His pictures\r\nare dainties in gold frames, jewels delicately set, astonishing efforts\r\nof patience lit up by a flashing, rocket-like _esprit_; but beneath the\r\nglittering surface one is conscious of there being neither heart nor\r\nsoul. His art might have been French or Italian, just as appropriately\r\nas Spanish. It is the art of virtuosi of the brush, and Fortuny himself\r\nis the initiator of a religion which found its enthusiastic followers,\r\nnot in Madrid alone, but in Naples, Paris, and Rome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  FORTUNY.   MOORS PLAYING WITH A VULTURE.]\r\n\r\nYet Spanish painting, so far as it is individual, works even now upon\r\nthe lines of Fortuny. After his death it divided into two streams. The\r\nofficial endeavour of the academies was to keep the grand historical\r\npainting in flower, in accord with the proud programme announced by\r\nFrancisco Tubino in his brochure, _The Renaissance of Spanish Art_. "Our\r\ncontemporary artists," he writes, "fill all civilised Europe with their\r\nfame, and are the object of admiration on the far side of the Atlantic.\r\nWe have a peculiar school of our own with a hundred teachers, and it\r\nshuns comparison with no school in any other country. At home the\r\nAcademy of the Fine Arts watches over the progress of painting; it has\r\nperfected the laws by which our Academy in Rome is guided, the Academy\r\nin the proud possession of Spain, and situated so splendidly upon the\r\nJaniculum. In Madrid there is a succession of biennial exhibitions, and\r\nthere is no deficiency in prizes nor in purchases. Spanish painting does\r\nnot merely adorn the citizen\'s house or the boudoir of the fair sex\r\nwith easel-pieces; by its productions it recalls the great episodes of\r\npopular history, which are able to excite men to glorious deeds.\r\nAustere, like our national character, it forbids fine taste to descend\r\nto the painting of anything indecorous. Before everything we want grand\r\npaintings for our galleries; the commercial spirit is no master of ours.\r\nIn such a way the glory of Zurburan, Murillo, and Velasquez lives once\r\nmore in a new sense."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  FORTUNY.   THE CHINA VASE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  FORTUNY.   AT THE GATE OF THE SERAGLIO.]\r\n\r\nThe results of such efforts were those historical pictures which at the\r\nParis World Exhibition of 1878, the Munich International Exhibition of\r\n1883, and at every large exhibition since have been so exceedingly\r\nrefreshing to all admirers of the illustration of history upon ground\r\nthat was genuinely Spanish. At the Paris World Exhibition of 1878\r\n_Pradilla\'s_ "Joan the Mad" received the large gold medal, and was,\r\nindeed, a good picture in the manner of Laurens. Philip the Fair is\r\ndead. The funeral train, paying him the last honours, has come to a halt\r\nupon a high-road, and the unhappy princess rushes up with floating hair\r\nand staring eyes fixed upon the bier which hides the remains of her\r\nhusband. The priests and women kneeling around regard the unfortunate\r\nmad woman with mournful pity. To the right the members of the Court are\r\ngrouped near a little chapel where a priest is celebrating a mass for\r\nthe dead; to the left the peasantry are crowding round to witness the\r\nceremony. Great wax candles are burning, and the chapel is lit up with\r\nthe sombre glow of torches. This was all exceedingly well painted,\r\ncarefully balanced in composition, and graceful in drawing. At the\r\nMunich Exhibition of 1883 he received a gold medal for his "Surrender of\r\nGranada, 1492," a picture which made a great impression at the time upon\r\nthe German historical painters, as Pradilla had made a transition from\r\nthe brown bituminous painting of Laurens to a "modern" painting in grey,\r\nwhich did more justice to the illumination of objects beneath the open\r\nsky. In the same year _Casado\'s_ large painting, "The Bells of Huesca,"\r\nwith the ground streaming with blood, fifteen decapitated bodies, and\r\nas many bodiless heads, was a creation which was widely admired. _Vera_\r\nhad exhibited his picture, filled with wild fire and pathos, "The\r\nDefence of Numantia," and _Manuel Ramirez_ his "Execution of Don Alvaro\r\nde Luna," with the pallid head which has rolled from the steps and\r\nstares at the spectator in such a ghastly manner. In his "Conversion of\r\nthe Duke of Gandia," _Moreno Carbonero_ displayed an open coffin _\xc3\xa0 la_\r\nLaurens: as Grand Equerry to the Empress Isabella at the Court of\r\nCharles V, the Duke of Gandia, after the death of his mistress, has to\r\nsuperintend the burial of her corpse in the vault at Granada, and as the\r\ncoffin is opened there, to confirm the identity of the person, the\r\ndistorted features of the dead make such a powerful impression upon the\r\ncareless noble that he takes a vow to devote himself to God. _Ricardo\r\nVillodas_ in his picture "Victoribus Gloria" represents the beginning of\r\none of those sea-battles which Augustus made gladiators fight for the\r\namusement of the Roman people. By _Antonio Casanova y Estorach_ there\r\nwas a picture of King Ferdinand the Holy, who upon Maundy Thursday is\r\nwashing the feet of eleven poor old men and giving them food. And a\r\nspecial sensation was made by the great ghost picture of _Benliure y\r\nGil_, which he named "A Vision in the Colosseum." Saint Almaquio, who\r\nwas slain, according to tradition, by gladiators in the Colosseum, is\r\nseen floating in the air, as he swings in fanatical ecstasy a crucifix\r\nfrom which light is streaming. Upon one side men who have borne witness\r\nto Christianity with their blood chant their hymns of praise; upon the\r\nother, troops of female martyrs clothed in white and holding tapers in\r\ntheir hands move by; but below, the earth has opened, and the dead rise\r\nfor the celebration of this midnight service, praying from their graves,\r\nwhile the full moon shines through the apertures of the ruins and pours\r\nits pale light upon the phantom congregation. There was exhibited by\r\n_Checa_ "A Barbarian Onset," a Gallic horde of riders thundering past a\r\nRoman temple, from which the priestesses are flying in desperation.\r\n_Francisco Amerigo_ treated upon a huge canvas a scene from the sacking\r\nof Rome in 1527, when the despoiling troops of Charles V plundered the\r\nEternal City. "Soldiers intoxicated with wine and lust, tricked out with\r\nbishops\' mitres and wrapped in the robes of priests, are desecrating the\r\ntemples of God. Nunneries are violated, and fathers kill their daughters\r\nto save them from shame." So ran the historical explanation set upon the\r\nbroad gold frame.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, these historical pictures, in spite of their great\r\nspaces of canvas, are of no consequence when one comes to characterise\r\nthe efforts of modern art. Explanations could be given showing that in\r\nthe land of bull-fights this painting of horrors maintained itself\r\nlonger than elsewhere, but the hopes of those who prophesied from it a\r\nnew golden period for historical painting were entirely disappointed.\r\nFor Spanish art, as in earlier days for French art, the historical\r\npicture has merely the importance implied by the _Prix de Rome_. A\r\nmethod of colouring which is often dazzling in result, and a vigorous\r\nstudy of nature, preserved from the danger of "beautiful" tinting, make\r\nthe Spanish works different from the older ones. Their very passion\r\noften has an effect which is genuine, brutal, and of telling power. In\r\nthe best of these pictures one believes that a wild temperament really\r\ndoes burst into flame through the accepted convention that the painters\r\nhave delight in the horrible, which the older French artists resorted to\r\nmerely for the purpose of preparing veritable _tableaux_. But in the\r\nrank and file, in place of the Southern vividness of expression which\r\nhas been sincerely felt, histrionic pose is the predominant element, the\r\npetty situation of the stage set upon a gigantic canvas, and in addition\r\nto this a straining after effect which grazes the boundary line where\r\nthe horrible degenerates into the ridiculous. Through their\r\nextraordinary ability they all compel respect, but they have not\r\nenriched the treasury of modern emotion, nor have they transformed the\r\nolder historical painting in the essence of its being. And the man who\r\nhandles again and again motives derived from what happens to be the mode\r\nin colours renders no service to art. Delaroche is dead; but though he\r\nmay be disinterred he cannot be brought to life, and the Spaniards\r\nmerely dug out of the earth mummies in which the breath of life was\r\nwanting. Their works are not directing-posts to the future, but the last\r\n_revenants_ of that histrionic spirit which wandered like a ghost\r\nthrough the art of all nations. Even the composition, the shining\r\ncolours, the settles and carpets picturesquely spread upon the ground,\r\nare the same as in Gallait. How often have these precious stage\r\nproperties done duty in tragic funereal service since Delaroche\'s\r\n"Murder of the Duke of Guise" and Piloty\'s "Seni"!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  PRADILLA.   THE SURRENDER OF GRANADA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kunst unserer Zeit._\r\n\r\n  PRADILLA.   ON THE BEACH.]\r\n\r\nAnd these conceptions, nourished upon historical painting, had an\r\ninjurious influence upon the handling of the modern picture of the\r\nperiod. Even here there is an endeavour to make a compromise with the\r\ntraditional historic picture, since artists painted scenes from modern\r\npopular life upon great spaces of canvas, transforming them into\r\npageants or pictures of tragical ceremonies, and sought too much after\r\nsubjects with which the splendid and motley colours of historical\r\npainting would accord. _Viniegra y Lasso_ and _Mas y Fondevilla_ execute\r\ngreat processions filing past, with bishops, monks, priests, and\r\nchoristers. All the figures stand beaming in brightness against the sky,\r\nbut the light glances from the oily mantles of the figures without real\r\neffect. _Alcazar Tejedor_ paints a young priest reading his "First Mass"\r\nin the presence of his parents, and merely renders a theatrical scene in\r\nmodern costume, merely transfers to an event of the present that\r\nfamiliar "moment of highest excitement" so popular since the time of\r\nDelaroche. By his "Death of the Matador," and "The Christening," bought\r\nby Vanderbilt for a hundred and fifty thousand francs, _Jos\xc3\xa9 Villegas_,\r\nin ability the most striking of them all, acquired a European name;\r\nwhilst a hospital scene by _Luis Jimenez_ of Seville is the single\r\npicture in which something of the seriousness of French Naturalism is\r\nperceptible, but it is an isolated example from a province of interest\r\nwhich is otherwise not to be found in Spain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VILLEGAS.   DEATH OF THE MATADOR.]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Spaniards are by no means most attractive in gravely\r\nceremonial and stiffly dignified pictures, but rather when they indulge\r\nin unpretentious "little painting" in the manner of Fortuny. Yet even\r\nthese wayward "little painters," with their varied glancing colour, are\r\nnot to be properly reckoned amongst the moderns. Their painting is an\r\nart dependent on deftness of hand, and knows no higher aim than to bring\r\ntogether in a picture as many brilliant things as possible, to make a\r\ncharming bouquet with glistening effects of costume, and the play, the\r\nreflections, and the caprices of sunbeams. The earnest modern art which\r\nsprang from Manet and the Fontainebleau painters avoids this\r\nkaleidoscopic sport with varied spots of colour. All these little folds\r\nand mouldings, these prismatic arts of blending, and these curious\r\nreflections are what the moderns have no desire to see: they half close\r\ntheir eyes to gain a clearer conception of the chief values; they\r\nsimplify; they refuse to be led from the main point by a thousand\r\ntrifles. Their pictures are works of art, while those of the disciples\r\nof Fortuny are sleights of artifice. In all this _bric-\xc3\xa0-brac_ art there\r\nis no question of any earnest analysis of light. The motley spots of\r\ncolour yield, no doubt, a certain concord of their own; but there is a\r\nwant of tone and air, a want of all finer sentiment: everything seems to\r\nhave been dyed, instead of giving the effect of colour. Nevertheless\r\nthose who were independent enough not to let themselves be entirely\r\nbewitched by the deceptive adroitness of a conjurer have painted little\r\npictures of talent and refinement; taking Fortuny\'s _rococo_ works as\r\ntheir starting-point, they have represented the fashionable world and\r\nthe highly coloured and warm-blooded life of the people of modern Spain\r\nwith a bold and spirited facility. But they have not gone beyond the\r\nobservation of the external sides of life. They can show guitarreros\r\nclattering with castanets and pandarets, majas dancing, and ribboned\r\nheroes conquering bulls instead of Jews and Moors. Yet their pictures\r\nare at any rate blithe, full of colour, flashing with sensuous\r\nbrilliancy, and at times they are executed with stupendous skill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  BENLIURE Y GIL.   A VISION IN THE COLOSSEUM.]\r\n\r\n_Martin Rico_ was for the longest period in Italy with Fortuny, and his\r\npictures also have the glitter of a casket of jewels, the pungency of\r\nsparkling champagne. Some of his sea-pieces in particular--for instance,\r\nthose of the canal in Venice and the Bay of Fontarabia--might have been\r\npainted by Fortuny. In others he seems quieter and more harmonious than\r\nthe latter. His execution is more powerful, less marked by spirited\r\nstippling, and his light gains in intensity and atmospheric refinement\r\nwhat it loses in mocking caprices, while his little figures have a more\r\nanimated effect, notwithstanding the less piquant manner in which they\r\nare painted. Their outlines are scarcely perceptible, and yet they are\r\nseen walking, jostling, and pressing against each other; whereas those\r\nof Fortuny, precisely through the more subtle and microscopic method in\r\nwhich they have been executed, often seem as though they were benumbed\r\nin movement. Certain market scenes, with a dense crowd of buyers and\r\nsellers, are peculiarly spirited, rapid sketches, with a gleaming charm\r\nof colour.\r\n\r\n_Zamacois_, _Casanova_, and _Raimundo de Madrazo_, Fortuny\'s\r\nbrother-in-law, show no less virtuosity of the palette. Sea-pieces and\r\nlittle landscapes alternate with scenes from Spanish popular life, where\r\nthey revel, like Fortuny, in a scintillating medley of colour. Later, in\r\nParis, Madrazo was likewise much sought after as a painter of ladies\'\r\nportraits, as he lavished on his pictures sometimes a fine _hautgo\xc3\xbbt_ of\r\nfragrant _rococo_ grace _a la_ Chaplin, and sometimes devoted himself\r\nwith taste and deftness to symphonic _tours de force \xc3\xa0 la_ Carolus\r\nDuran. Particularly memorable is the portrait of a graceful young girl\r\nin red, exhibited in the Munich Exhibition of 1883. She is seated upon a\r\nsofa of crimson silk, and her feet rest upon a dark red carpet. Equally\r\nmemorable in the Paris World Exhibition of 1889 was a pierrette, whose\r\ncostume ran through the whole gamut from white to rose-colour. Her skirt\r\nwas of a darker, her bodice of a brighter red, and a light rose-coloured\r\nstocking peeped from beneath a grey silk petticoat; over her shoulders\r\nlay a white swansdown cape, and white gloves and white silk shoes with\r\nrose-coloured bows completed her toilette. His greatest picture\r\nrepresented "The End of a Masked Ball." Before the Paris Opera cabs are\r\nwaiting with coachmen sleeping or smoking, whilst a troop of pierrots\r\nand pierrettes, harlequins, Japanese girls, _rococo_ gentlemen, and\r\nTurkish women are streaming out, sparkling with the most glittering\r\ncolours in the grey light of a winter morning, in which the gas lamps\r\ncast a warm yellow glimmer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASADO.   THE BELLS OF HUESCA.]\r\n\r\nEven those who made their chief success as historical painters became\r\nnew beings when they came forward with such piquant "little paintings."\r\n_Francisco Domingo_ in Valencia is the Spanish Meissonier, who has\r\npainted little horsemen before an inn, mercenary soldiers, newspaper\r\nreaders, and philosophers of the time of Louis XV, with all the\r\ndaintiness in colour associated with the French patriarch--although a\r\nhuge canvas, "The Last Day of Sagunt," has the reputation of being his\r\nchief performance. In the year in which he exhibited his "Vision in the\r\nColosseum," _Benliure y Gil_ made a success with two little pictures\r\nstippled in varied colours, the "Month of Mary" and the "Distribution\r\nof Prizes in Valencia," in which children, smartened and dressed in\r\nwhite frocks, are moving in the ante-chambers of a church, decorated for\r\nthe occasion. _Casado_, painter of the sanguinary tragedy of Huesca,\r\nshowed himself an admirable little master full of elegance and grace in\r\n"The Bull-Fighter\'s Reward," a small eighteenth-century picture. The\r\nmaster of the great hospital picture, _Jimenez_, took the world by\r\nsurprise at the very same time by a "Capuchin Friar\'s Sermon before the\r\nCathedral of Seville," which flashed with colour. _Emilio Sala y\r\nFranc\xc3\xa9s_, whose historical masterpiece was the "Expulsion of the Jews\r\nfrom Spain in 1493," delights elsewhere in spring, Southern gardens with\r\nluxuriant vegetation, and delicate _rococo_ ladies, holding up their\r\nskirts filled with blooming roses, or gathering wild flowers among the\r\ngrass. _Antonio Fabr\xc3\xa9s_ was led to the East by the influence of\r\nRegnault, and excited attention by his aquarelles and studies in pen and\r\nink, in which he represented Oriental and Roman street figures with\r\nastonishing adroitness. But the _ne plus ultra_ is attained by the bold\r\nand winning art of _Pradilla_, which is like a thing shot out of a\r\npistol. He is the greatest product of contemporary Spain, a man with a\r\ntalent for improvisation as ingenious as it was free, who treated with\r\nequal facility the most varied subjects. In the bold and spirited\r\ndecorations with which he embellished Spanish palaces he sported with\r\nnymphs and Loves and floating genii _\xc3\xa0 la_ Tiepolo. All the grace of the\r\n_rococo_ period is cast over his works in the Palais Murga in Madrid.\r\nThe figures join each other with ease--coquettish nymphs swaying upon\r\nboughs, and audacious "Putti" tumbling over backwards in quaint games.\r\nNowhere is there academic sobriety, and everywhere life, pictorial\r\ninspiration, the intoxicating joyousness of a fancy creating without\r\neffort and revelling in the festal delight of the senses. In the\r\naccompanying wall pictures he revived the age of the troubadours, of\r\nlanguishing love-song and knightly romance free from the burden of\r\nthought, in tenderly graceful and fluent figures. And this same painter,\r\nwho filled these huge spaces of wall, lightly dallying with subjects\r\nfrom the world of fable, seems another man when he grasps fragments from\r\nthe life of our own age in pithy inspirations sure in achievement. His\r\nhistorical pictures are works which compel respect; but those paintings\r\non the most diminutive scale, in which he represented scenes from the\r\nRoman carnival and the life in Spanish camps, the shore of the sea and\r\nthe joy of a popular merry-making with countless figures of the most\r\nintense vividness, carried out with an unrivalled execution of detail\r\nwhich is yet free from anything laboured, and full of splendour and\r\nglowing colour,--these, indeed, are performances of painting beside\r\nwhich as a musical counterpart at best Paganini\'s variations on the G\r\nstring are comparable--sleights of art of which only Pradilla was\r\ncapable, and such as only Fortuny painted forty years ago.\r\n\r\nTwo masters who do not live at home, but in France, have followed still\r\nfurther the modern development of art with great power. The first is\r\n_Zuloaga_. The pictures of this artist have something truly Spanish,\r\nsomething that one as an admirer of Goya looks for eagerly in Spanish\r\npictures. At the first glance the eye receives rather a shock. One seeks\r\nin vain for delicate painting of light in Zuloaga, or exquisite\r\nharmonies of colour. He places the crudest reds and yellows next to each\r\nother, strong, almost brutal, like a poster. With an uncompromising love\r\nof truth he paints the rouge-smeared cheeks and blackened eyebrows of\r\nhis women-about-town, does not even try to make their movements graceful\r\nor give their costumes a touch of modish smartness. But what a breadth\r\nof conception! With what daring he sweeps his bold strokes over the\r\npicture! It is just because he avoids all flattery, because he brings\r\nnothing foreign, nothing cosmopolitan into his exclusive world, that the\r\ncharacteristics of Spanish life are mirrored with such truth in his\r\nworks. Especially in his portrait of the popular poet, Don Miguel de\r\nSegovia, the whole picture is suffused with a rare Don Quixote feeling.\r\nVelasquez\' Pablillas stands before you reincarnated. It is interesting,\r\ntoo, that Zuloaga, though in France, remains still a Spaniard. Even when\r\nhe paints Parisiennes he translates toilette and gesture into grandiose\r\nSpanish style.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the French school is much more marked in the second of\r\nthese Spanish masters, _Hermen Anglada_. He has come to the front in\r\nthe exhibitions of the last few years. Besnard has given him much of\r\nhis refined epicurism, and this French _hautgo\xc3\xbbt_ lends his pictures a\r\ncharm which is altogether their own. If you are seeking for unusual and\r\nquaint effects you will find them in this Spaniard, who paints pale,\r\ncolourless women in the most astonishing costumes, places them in the\r\nmidst of sensuous, misty landscapes, and gives you a glistening\r\npotpourri of colours. But Anglada\'s work is in itself the best testimony\r\nto the fact that the Spain of to-day is getting worn-out and bloodless.\r\nThere is something senile and sapless in this over-refined art that\r\ntakes pleasure in nothing but the most extraordinary nuances, and that\r\nneeds something very unusual to tickle its nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nITALY\r\n\r\n\r\nItaly has played a very different part from that of Spain in the\r\ndevelopment of modern art. Even at the World Exhibition of 1855 Edmond\r\nAbout called Italy "the grave of painting" in his _Voyage \xc3\xa0 travers\r\nl\'Exposition des Beaux-Arts_. He mentions a few Piedmontese professors,\r\nbut about Florence, Naples, and Rome he found nothing to say. The Great\r\nExhibition of 1862 in England was productive of no more favourable\r\ncriticism, for W. B\xc3\xbcrger\'s account is as little consolatory as About\'s.\r\n"Renowned Italy and proud Spain," writes Burger, "have no longer any\r\npainters who can rival those of other schools. There is nothing to be\r\nsaid about the rooms where the Italians, Spanish, and Swiss are\r\nexhibited." To-day there are in Italy a great number of vigorous\r\npainters. In Angelo de Gubernati\'s lexicon of artists there are over two\r\nthousand names, some of which are favourably known in other countries\r\nalso. But the mass dwindles to a tiny heap if those only are included\r\nwho have risen from the level of dexterous picture-makers to that of\r\npainters of real importance in the world of art.\r\n\r\nWhether it be from direct influence or similarity of origin, Fortuny has\r\nfound his ablest successors amongst the Neapolitan artists. As early as\r\nthe seventeenth century the school of painting there was very different\r\nfrom those in the rest of Italy; the Greek blood of the population and\r\nthe wild, romantic scenery of the Abruzzi gave it a peculiar stamp.\r\nSouthern _brio_, the joy of life, colour, and warmth, in contrast with\r\nthe noble Roman ideal of form, were the qualities of Salvator Rosa, Luca\r\nGiordano, and Ribera, bold and fiery spirits. And a breath of such power\r\nseems to live in their descendants still. Even now Neapolitan painting\r\nsings, dances, and laughs in a bacchanal of colour, pleasure, delight in\r\nlife, and glowing sunshine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kunst f\xc3\xbcr Alle._\r\n\r\n  MORELLI.   THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY.]\r\n\r\nA wild and restless spirit, _Domenico Morelli_, whose biography is like\r\na chapter from _Rinaldo Rinaldini_, is the head of this Neapolitan\r\nschool. He was born on 4th August, 1826, and in his youth he is said to\r\nhave been, first a pupil in a seminary of priests, then an apprentice\r\nwith a mechanician, and for some time even _facchino_. He never saw such\r\na thing as an academy. Indeed, it was a Bohemian life that he led,\r\nmaking his meals of bread and cheese, wandering for weeks together with\r\nByron\'s poems in his pocket upon the seashore between Posilippo and\r\nBai\xc3\xa6. In 1848 he fought against King Ferdinand, and was left severely\r\nwounded on the battle-field. After these episodes of youth he first\r\nbecame a painter, beginning his career in 1855 with the large picture\r\n"The Iconoclasts," followed in 1857 by a "Tasso," and in 1858 by a "Saul\r\nand David." Biblical pictures remained his province even later, and he\r\nwas the only artist in Italy who handled these subjects from an entirely\r\nnovel point of view, pouring into them a peculiarly exalted and\r\nimaginative spirit. A Madonna rocking her sleeping Child, whilst her\r\nsong is accompanied by a legion of cherubs playing upon instruments,\r\n"The Reviling of Christ," "The Ascension," "The Descent from the Cross,"\r\n"Christ walking on the Sea," "The Raising of the Daughter of Jairus,"\r\n"The Expulsion of the Money-Changers from the Temple," "The Marys at the\r\nGrave," "Salve Regina," and "Mary Magdalene meeting Christ risen from\r\nthe Grave," are the principal stages of his great Christian epic, and in\r\ntheir imaginative naturalism a new revolutionary language finds\r\nutterance through all these pictures. There is in them at times\r\nsomething of the mystical quietude of the East, and at times something\r\nof the passionate breath of Eug\xc3\xa8ne Delacroix. In these pictures he\r\nrevealed himself as a true child of the land of the sun, a lover of\r\npainting which scintillates and flickers. As yet hard, ponderous, dark,\r\nand plastic in "The Iconoclasts," he was a worshipper of light and\r\nresplendent in colour in the "Mary Magdalene." "The Temptation of St.\r\nAnthony" probably marks the summit of his creative power in the matter\r\nof colour. Morelli has conceived the whole temptation as a\r\nhallucination. The saint squats upon the ground, claws with his fingers,\r\nand with fixed gaze tries to stifle thoughts, full of craving\r\nsensuality, which are flaming in him. Yet they throng ever more\r\nthickly, take shape ever more distinctly, are transformed into\r\nred-haired women who detach themselves from corners upon all sides. They\r\nrise from beneath the matting, wind nearer from the depth of the cavern;\r\neven the breeze that caresses the fevered brow of the tormented man\r\nchanges into the head of a girl pressing her kisses upon him. Only\r\nNaples could produce an artist at once so bizarre, so many-sided and\r\nincoherent, so opulent and strange. Younger men of talent trooped around\r\nhim. A fiery spirit, haughty and independent, he became the teacher of\r\nall the younger generation. He led them to behold the sun and the sea,\r\nto marvel at nature in her radiant brightness. Through him the joy in\r\nlight and colour came into Neapolitan painting, that rejoicing in colour\r\nwhich touches such laughing concords in the works of his pupil _Paolo\r\nMichetti_.\r\n\r\nA man of bold and magnificent talent, the genuine product of the wild\r\nAbruzzi, Michetti was the son of a day-labourer, like Morelli. However,\r\na man of position became the protector of the boy, who was early left an\r\norphan. But neither at the Academy at Naples nor in Paris and London did\r\nthis continue long. As early as 1876 he was back in Naples, and settled\r\namid the Abruzzi, close to the Adriatic, in Francavilla \xc3\xa0 Mare, near\r\nOstona, a little nest which the traveller passes just before he goes on\r\nboard the Oriental steamer at Brindisi. Here he lives out of touch with\r\nold pictures, in the thick of the vigorous life of the Italian people.\r\nIn 1877 he painted the work which laid the foundation of his celebrity,\r\n"The Corpus Domini Procession at Chieti," a picture which rose like a\r\nfirework in its boisterous, exhilarating medley of bright colours. The\r\nprocession is seen just coming out of church: men, women, naked\r\nchildren, monks, priests, a canopy, choristers with censers, old men and\r\nyouths, people who kneel and people who laugh, the mist of incense, the\r\nbeams of the sun, flowers scattered on the ground, a band of musicians,\r\nand a church fa\xc3\xa7ade with rich and many-coloured ornaments. There is the\r\nplay of variously hued silk, and colours sparkle in all the tints of the\r\nprism. Everything laughs, the faces and the costumes, the flowers and\r\nthe sunbeams. Following upon this came a picture which he called "Spring\r\nand the Loves." It represented a desolate promontory in the blue sea,\r\nand upon it a troop of Cupids, playing round a hawthorn bush in full\r\nflower, are scuffling, buffeting each other, and leaping as riotously as\r\nNeapolitan street-boys. Some were arrayed like little Japanese, some\r\nlike Grecian terra-cotta figures, whilst a marble bridge in the\r\nneighbourhood shone in indigo blue. The whole picture gleamed with red,\r\nblue, green, and yellow patches of colour: a serpentine dance painted\r\ntwelve years before the appearance of Loie Fuller. Then again he painted\r\nthe sea. It is noon, and the sultry heat broods over the azure tide.\r\nNaked fishermen are standing in it, and on the shore gaily dressed women\r\nare searching for mussels; whilst, in the background, vessels with the\r\nsun playing on their sails are mirrored brightly in the water. Or the\r\nmoon rises casting greenish reflections upon the body of Christ, which\r\nshines like phosphorus as it is being taken from the cross: or there is\r\na flowery landscape upon a summer evening; birds are settling down for\r\nthe night, and little angels are kissing each other and laughing. In all\r\nthese pictures Michetti showed himself an improviser of astonishing\r\ndexterity, solving every difficulty as though it were child\'s play, and\r\nshedding a brilliant colour over everything--a man to whom "painting"\r\nwas as much a matter of course as orthography is to ourselves. Even the\r\nParis World Exhibition of 1878 made him celebrated as an artist, and\r\nfrom that time his name was to the Italian ear a symbol for something\r\nnew, unexpected, wild, and extravagant. The word "Michetti" means\r\nsplendid materials, dazzling flesh-tones, conflicting hues set with\r\nintention beside each other, the luxuriant bodies of women basking in\r\nheat and sun, fantastic landscapes created in the mad brain of the\r\nartist, strange and curious frames, and village idylls in the glowing\r\nblaze of the sun. There are no lifeless spots in his works; every whim\r\nof his takes shape, as if by sorcery, in splendid figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  MICHETTI.   GOING TO CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nAnother pupil of Morelli, _Edoardo Dalbono_, completed his duty to\r\nhistory by a scene of horror _\xc3\xa0 la_ Laurens, "The Excommunication of\r\nKing Manfred," and then became the painter of the Bay of Naples. "The\r\nIsle of Sirens" was the first production of his able, appetising, and\r\nnervously vibrating brush. There is a steep cliff dropping sheer into\r\nthe blue sea. Two antique craft are drawing near, the crews taking no\r\nheed of the reefs and sandbanks. With phantomlike gesture the naked\r\nwomen stretch out their arms beckoning, embodiments as they are of the\r\ndeadly beautiful and voluptuously cruel ocean. By degrees the sea\r\nbetrayed to him all its secrets--its strangest combinations of colour\r\nand atmospheric effects, its transparency, and its eternally shifting\r\nphases of ebb and flow. He has painted the Bay of Naples under bright,\r\nhot noon and the gloom of night, in the purple light of the sinking sun\r\nand in the strange and many-coloured mood of twilight. At one moment it\r\nshines and plays variegated and joyous in blue, grass-green, and violet\r\ntones; at another it seems to glitter with millions of phosphorescent\r\nsparks: the rosy clouds of the sky are glassed in it, and the lights of\r\nthe houses irregularly dotted over abrupt mountain-chains or the\r\ndark-red glow of lava luridly shining from Vesuvius. Now and then he\r\npainted scenes from Neapolitan street-life--old, weather-beaten seamen,\r\nyoung sailors with features as sharply cut as if cast in bronze,\r\nbeautiful, fiery, brown women, shooting the hot Southern flame from\r\ntheir eyes, houses painted white or orange-yellow, with the sun\r\nglittering on the windows. The "Voto alla Madonna del Carmine" was the\r\nmost comprehensive of these Southern pictures. Everything shines in\r\njoyous blue, yellowish-green, and red colours. Warmth, life, light,\r\nbrilliancy, and laughter are the elements on which his art is based.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Kunst f\xc3\xbcr Alle._\r\n\r\n  MICHETTI.   THE CORPUS DOMINI PROCESSION AT CHIETI.]\r\n\r\n_Alceste Campriani_, _Giacomo di Chirico_, _Rubens Santoro_, _Federigo\r\nCortese_, _Francesco Netti_, _Edoardo Toffano_, _Giuseppe de Nigris_\r\nhave, all of them, this kaleidoscopic sparkle, this method of painting\r\nwhich gives pictures the appearance of being mosaics of precious stones.\r\nAs in the days of the Renaissance, the Church is usually the scene of\r\naction, though not any longer as the house of God, but as the background\r\nof a many-coloured throng. As a rule these pictures contain a crowd of\r\ncanopies, priests, and choristers, and country-folk, bowing or kneeling\r\nwhen the host is carried by, or weddings, horse-races, and country\r\nfestivals; and everything is vivid and joyous in colour, saturated with\r\nthe glowing sun of Naples. Alceste Campriani\'s chief work was entitled\r\n"The Return from Montevergine." Carriages and open rack-waggons are\r\ndashing along, the horses snorting and the drivers smacking their whips,\r\nwhile the peasants, who have had their fill of sweet wine, are shouting\r\nand singing, and the orange-sellers in the street are crying their\r\ngoods. A coquettish glancing light plays over the gay costumes, and the\r\nwhite dust sparkles like fluid silver, as it rises beneath the hoofs of\r\nthe horses wildly plunging forward. The leading work of _Giacomo di\r\nChirico_, who became mad in 1883, was "A Wedding in the Basilicata." It\r\nrepresents a motley crowd. The entire village has set out to see the\r\nceremony. The wedding guests are descending the church steps to the\r\nsquare, which is decked out with coloured carpets and strewn with\r\nflowers. Triumphal arches have been set up, and the pictures of the\r\nMadonna are hung with garlands. Meanwhile the _sindaco_ gives his arm to\r\nthe bride, beneath whose gay costume a charmingly graceful little foot\r\nis peeping out. Then the bridegroom follows with the _sindaco\'s_ wife.\r\nAll the village girls are looking on with curiosity, and the musicians\r\nare playing. Winter has covered the square with a white cloak of snow;\r\nyet the sunbeams sport over it, making it shine vividly with a thousand\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  FAVRETTO.   ON THE PIAZZETTA.]\r\n\r\nOf course, the derivation of all these pictures is easily recognisable.\r\nAlmost all the Neapolitan painters studied at Fortuny\'s in the seventies\r\nin Rome, and when they came home again they perceived that the life of\r\nthe people offered themes which had a coquettish fitness in Fortuny\'s\r\nscale of tones. From the variously coloured magnificence of old\r\nchurches, the red robes of ecclesiastics, the gaudy splendour of the\r\ncountry-people\'s clothes, and the gay glory of rags amongst the\r\nNeapolitan children, they composed a modern _rococo_, rejoicing in\r\ncolour, whilst the Spaniard had fled to the past to attain his gleaming\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nA great number of the Italians do the same even now. In numerous costume\r\npictures, from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, flashing with\r\nsilk and velvet, the Southerner\'s bright pleasure in colour still loves\r\nto celebrate its orgies. Gay trains rustle, rosy Loves laugh down from\r\nthe walls, Venetian chandeliers shed their radiance; no other epoch in\r\nhistory enables the painter with so much ease to produce such an\r\nefflorescence of full-toned chords of colour. With his shining glow of\r\nhue the delectable and spirited _Favretto_ (who, like Fortuny, entered\r\nthe world of art as a victor, and, like him again, was snatched from it\r\nwhen barely thirty-seven, after a brief and brilliant career) stands at\r\nthe head of this group. The child of poor parents, indeed the son of a\r\njoiner, he was born in Venice in 1849, and, like the Spaniard, passed a\r\nyouth which was full of privations. But all the cares of existence, even\r\nthe loss of an eye, did not hinder him from seeing objects under a\r\nlaughing brightness of colour. Through his studies and the bent of his\r\nfancy he had come to be no less at home in the Venice of the eighteenth\r\ncentury than in that of his own time. This Venice of Francesco Guardi,\r\nthis city of enchantment surrounded with the gleam of olden splendour,\r\nthe scene of rich and brilliantly coloured banquets and a graceful and\r\nmodish society, rose once more under Favretto\'s hands in fabulous\r\nbeauty. What _brio_ of technique, what harmony of colours, were to be\r\nfound in the picture "Un Incontro," the charming scene upon the Rialto\r\nBridge, with the bowing cavalier and the lady coquettishly making her\r\nacknowledgments! This was the first picture which gave him a name in the\r\nworld. What fanfares of colour were in the two next pictures, "Banco\r\nLotto" and "Erbajuolo Veneziano"! At the Exhibition in Turin in 1883 he\r\nwas represented by "The Bath" and "Susanna and the Elders"; at that in\r\nVenice in 1887 he celebrated his last and greatest triumph. The three\r\npictures "The Friday Market upon the Rialto Bridge," "The Canal Ferry\r\nnear Santa Margherita," and "On the Piazzetta" were the subject of\r\nenthusiastic admiration. All the Venetian society of the age of Goldoni,\r\nGozzi, and Casanova had become vivid in this last picture, and moved\r\nover the smooth brick pavement of the Piazzetta at the hour of the\r\npromenade, from the Doge\'s palace to the library, and from the Square of\r\nSt. Mark to the pillar of the lions and Theodore, to and fro in surging\r\nlife. Men put up their glasses and chivalrously greeted the queens of\r\nbeauty. The enchanting magic building of Sansovino, the _loggetta_ with\r\ntheir bright marble pillars, bronze statues of blackish-grey, and\r\nmagnificent lattice doors, formed the background of the standing and\r\nsauntering groups, whose variegated costumes united with the tones of\r\nmarble and bronze to make a most beautiful combination of colours.\r\nFavretto had a manner of his own, and, although a member of the school\r\nof Fortuny, he was stronger and healthier than the latter. He drew like\r\na genuine painter, without having too much of the Fortuny fireworks. His\r\nsoft, rich painting was that of a colourist of distinction, always\r\ntasteful, exquisite in tone, and light and pleasing in technique.\r\n\r\nBy the other Italian costume painters the scale run through by Fortuny\r\nwas not enriched by new notes. Most of their pictures are nugatory,\r\ncoquettishly sportive toys, masterly in technique no doubt, but so empty\r\nof substance that they vanish from memory like novels read upon a\r\nrailway journey. Many have no greater import than dresses, cloaks, and\r\nhats worn by ladies during a few weeks of the season. Sometimes their\r\nsignificance is not even so great, since there are modistes and\r\ndressmakers who have more skill in making ruches and giving the right\r\n_nuance_ to colours. Some small part of Favretto\'s refined taste seems\r\nto have been communicated to the Venetian _Antonio Lonza_, who delights\r\nin mingling the gleaming splendour of Oriental carpets, fans, and\r\nscreens amid the motley, picturesque costumes of the _rococo_\r\nperiod--Japanese who perform as jugglers and knife-throwers in quaint\r\n_rococo_ gardens before the old Venetian nobility. But the centre of\r\nthis costume painting is Florence, and the great mart for it the\r\n_Societ\xc3\xa0 artistica_, where there are yearly exhibitions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  FAVRETTO.   SUSANNA AND THE ELDERS.]\r\n\r\nFrancesco Vinea, Tito Conti, Federigo Andreotti, and Edoardo Gelli are\r\nin Italy the special manufacturers who have devoted themselves, with the\r\nassistance of Meissonier, G\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me, and Fortuny, to scenes from the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, to plumed hats, Wallenstein boots,\r\nand horsemen\'s capes, to Renaissance lords and laughing Renaissance\r\nladies, and they have thereby won great recognition in Germany. Pretty,\r\nlanguishing women in richly coloured costumes, tippling soldiers and\r\ngallant cavaliers, laughing peasant women and trim serving-girls drawing\r\nwine in the cellar vaults and setting it before a trooper, who in\r\ngratitude affectionately puts his arm round their waist, beautiful and\r\nstill more languishing noble ladies, who laugh with a parrot or a dog,\r\ninstead of a trooper, in apartments richly furnished with Gobelins--such\r\nfor the most part are the subjects treated by _Francesco Vinea_ with\r\ngreat virtuosity bordering on the routine of a typewriter. His technique\r\nis neither refined nor fascinating; the colours are so crude that they\r\naffect the eye as a false note the ear. But the mechanical power of his\r\npainting is great. He has much ability, far more, indeed, than Sichel,\r\nand possesses the secret of painting, in an astonishing manner, the\r\nfamous lace kerchiefs wound round the heads of his fair ones.\r\n_Andreotti_ and _Tito Conti_ work in the same fashion, except that the\r\nballad-singers and rustic idylls of Andreotti are the smoother and more\r\nmawkish, whereas the pictures of Conti make a somewhat more refined and\r\nartistic effect. His colour is superior and more transparent, and his\r\ntapestry backgrounds are warmer.\r\n\r\nAnd, so far as one can judge from their pictures, life runs as merrily\r\nfor the Italians of the present as it did for those _rococo_ cavaliers.\r\nHanging here and there beside the serious art of other nations, these\r\nlittle picture-people enjoy their careless tinsel pomp; art is a gay\r\nthing for them, as gay as a Sunday afternoon with a procession and\r\nfireworks, walks and sips of sherbet, to an Italian woman. By the side\r\nof the blue-plush and red-velvet costume-picture comic _genre_ still\r\nholds its sway: barbaric in colour and with materials which are merrier\r\nthan is appropriate in tasteful pictures, _Gaetano Chierici_ represents\r\nchildren, both good and naughty, making their appearance upon a tiny\r\ntheatre. _Antonio Rotta_ renders comic episodes from the life of\r\nVenetian cobblers and the menders of nets. _Scipione Vannuttelli_ paints\r\nyoung girls in white dresses arrayed as nuns or being confirmed in\r\nchurch. _Francesco Monteverde_ rejoices in comical _intermezzi_ in the\r\nstyle of Gr\xc3\xbctzner--for instance, an ecclesiastical gentleman observing,\r\nto his horror, that his pretty young servant-girl is being kissed by a\r\nsmart lad in the yard. This is more or less his style of subject.\r\n_Ettore Tito_ paints the pretty Venetian laundresses whom Passini, Cecil\r\nvan Haanen, Charles Ulrich, Eug\xc3\xa8ne Blaas, and others introduced into\r\nart. Only a very few struck deeper notes. _Luigi Nono_, in Venice,\r\npainted his beautiful picture "Refugium Peccatorum"; _Ferragutti_, the\r\nMilanese, his "Workers in the Turnip Field," a vivid study of sunlight\r\nof serious veracity; and after these _Giovanni Segantini_ came forward\r\nwith his forcible creations, in which he has demonstrated that it is\r\npossible for a man to be an Italian and yet a serious artist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hanfstaengl._\r\n\r\n  TITO.   THE SLIPPER SELLER.]\r\n\r\nSegantini\'s biography is like a novel. Born the child of poor parents,\r\nin Arco, in 1858, he was left, after the death of his parents, to the\r\ncare of a relative in Milan with whom he passed a most unhappy time. He\r\nthen wanted to make his fortune in France, and set out upon foot; but he\r\ndid not get very far, in fact he managed to hire himself out as a\r\nswine-herd. After this he lived for a whole year alone in the wild\r\nmountains, worked in the field, the stable, the barn. Then came the\r\nwell-known discovery, which one could not believe were it not to be read\r\nin Gubernati. One day he drew the finest of his pigs with a piece of\r\ncharcoal upon a mass of rock. The peasants ran in a crowd and took the\r\nblock of stone, together with the young Giotto, in triumph to the\r\nvillage. He was given assistance, visited the School of Art in Milan,\r\nand now paints the things he did in his youth. In a secluded village of\r\nthe Alps, Val d\'Albola in Switzerland, a thousand metres above the sea,\r\namid the grand and lofty mountains, he settled down, surrounded only by\r\nthe peasants who make a precarious living from the soil. Out of touch\r\nwith the world of artists the whole year round, observing great nature\r\nat every season and every hour of the day, fresh and straightforward in\r\ncharacter, he is one of those natures of the type of Millet, in whom\r\nheart and hand, man and artist, are one and the same thing. His shepherd\r\nand peasant scenes from the valleys of the high Alps are free from all\r\nflavour of _genre_. The life of these poor and humble beings passes\r\nwithout contrasts and passions, being spent altogether in work, which\r\nfills the long course of the day in monotonous regularity. The sky\r\nsparkles with a sharp brilliancy. The spiky yellow and tender green of\r\nthe fields forces its way modestly from the rocky ground. In front is\r\nsomething like a hedge where a cow is grazing, or there is a shepherdess\r\npasturing her sheep. Something majestic there is in this cold nature,\r\nwhere the sunshine is so sharp, the air so thin. And the primitive, it\r\nmight almost be said antique, execution of these pictures is in accord\r\nwith the primitive simplicity of the subjects. In fact, Segantini\'s\r\npictures, with their cold silvery colours, and their contours so sharp\r\nin outline, standing out hard against the rarefied air, make an\r\nimpression like encaustic paintings or mosaics. They have nothing\r\nalluring or pleasing, and there is, perhaps, even a touch of mannerism\r\nin this mosaic painting; but they are nevertheless exceedingly true,\r\nrugged, austere, and yet sunny. Segantini opened up to painting an\r\nentirely new world of beauty, the poetry of the highlands. His\r\nappearance dates from the Impressionistic period when preference was\r\ngiven to damp, misty atmospheres which toned down all colour and melted\r\naway all lines, and artists made a specialty of flat, monotonous plains.\r\nAt that time the mountains were in bad repute, thanks to the\r\nold-fashioned painters of views, the masters of the "picture-postcard\r\nstyle." Segantini led the way again up to the heights; but he did not\r\npaint the mountain-tops that, like the Titans of old, strive to reach\r\nthe sky; he painted the plateaus, not the plains of the lowlands, but of\r\nthe highlands, lonely, weird, sublime, where man draws near to the heart\r\nof Nature, far from the noise and struggle of everyday life. The air of\r\nthe heights is there, the colours and lines speak with no uncertain\r\nvoice. Thus Segantini learnt from the locale of his pictures to become\r\nthe first master of line among the Impressionists. How he mirrors in his\r\npictures the stillness, the might and grandeur of these lofty heights!\r\nWith what astounding truth his cold, clear colours make us feel the\r\ncoldness and clearness of these regions. Like a dome of steel, the sky\r\nstretches over the steel-blue lakes, clear as crystal, over the\r\npale-green meadows in the grip of the frost; the tender foliage rustles\r\nand freezes in the quivering ice-cold air: there glaciers gleam, there\r\nglitters the snow, there the sun pours down his beams upon the earth\r\nlike plumes of fire. A thunder cloud draws near, calm and majestic as\r\ndestiny in its relentless course. There is something Northern and\r\nvirginal, something earnest and grandiose, which stands in strange\r\ncontrast with the joyful, conventional smile which is otherwise spread\r\nover the countenance of Italian painting. Though he died so young,\r\nGiovanni Segantini will live for all time in the history of art.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Segantini, not one of these painters will own that\r\nthere are poverty-stricken and miserable people in his native land. An\r\neverlasting blue sky still laughs over Italy, sunshine and the joy of\r\nlife still hold undisputed sway over Italian pictures. There is no work\r\nin sunny Italy, and in spite of that there is no hunger. Even where work\r\nis being done there are assembled only the fairest girls of Lombardy,\r\nwho kneel laughing and jesting on the strand, while the wind dallies\r\nwith their clothes. They have a special delight for showing themselves\r\nwhile engaged at their toilette, in a bodice, their little feet in neat\r\nlittle slippers, their naked arms raised to arrange their red-gold hair.\r\nAs a rule, however, they do nothing whatever but smile at you with their\r\nmost seductive smile, which shows their pearl-white teeth, and ensnares\r\nevery poor devil who does not suspect that they have smiled for years in\r\nthe same way, and most of all with him who pays highest: "_j\'aime les\r\nhommes parse que j\'aime les truffes_." These pictures are almost\r\ninvariably works which are well able to give pleasure to their\r\npossessor, only they seldom suggest discussion on the course of art.\r\n_Trop de marchandise_ is the phrase generally used in the Paris Salon\r\nwhen the Italians come under consideration. Few there are amongst them\r\nwho are real pioneers, spirits pressing seriously forward and having a\r\nquickening influence on others. The vital questions of the painting of\r\nfree light, Impressionism, and Naturalism do not interest them in the\r\nleast. A na\xc3\xafve, pleasant, lively, and self-complacent technique is in\r\nmost cases the solitary charm of their works. One feels scarcely any\r\ninclination to search the catalogue for the painter\'s name, and whether\r\nthe beauty--for she is not the first of her kind--who was called Ninetta\r\nlast year has now become Lisa. Most of these modern Italians execute\r\ntheir pictures in the way in which gold pieces are minted, or in the way\r\nin which plastic works, which run through so many editions, are produced\r\nin Italy. Nowhere are more beautiful laces chiselled, and in the same\r\nmanner painters render the shining splendour of satin and velvet, the\r\nglittering brilliancy of ornaments, and the starry radiance of the\r\nbeautiful eyes of women. Only, as soon as one has once seen them one\r\nknows the pictures by heart, as one knows the works in marble, and this\r\nis so because the painters had them by heart first. Everywhere there are\r\nthe evidences of talent, industry, ability, and spirit, but there is no\r\nsoul in the spirit and no life in the colours. So many brilliant tones\r\nstand beside each other, and yet there is neither a refined tone nor the\r\nimpression of truth to nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEGANTINI.   MATERNITY.]\r\n\r\nIn all this art of theirs there is scarcely a question of any serious\r\nlandscape. Apart from the works of some of the younger men--for\r\ninstance, _Belloni_, _Serra_, _Gola_, _Filippini_, and others, who\r\ndisplay an intimacy of observation which is worthy of honour--a really\r\nclose connection with the efforts made across the Alps is not achieved\r\nin these days. As a rule the landscapes are mere products of\r\nhandicraft, which are striking for the moment by their technical\r\nroutine, but seldom waken any finer feelings, whether the Milanese paint\r\nthe dazzling Alpine effects or the Venetian lagunes steeped in light,\r\nwith gondolas and gondola-poles glowing in the sunshine, or the\r\nNeapolitans set glittering upon the canvas their beautiful bay like a\r\nbrilliant firework. Most of them continue to pursue with complete\r\nself-satisfaction the flagged gondola of Ziem; the conquests of the\r\nFontainebleau painters and of the Impressionists are unnoticed by them.\r\n\r\nAnd this industrial characteristic of Italian painting is sufficiently\r\nexplained by the entire character of the country. The Italian painter is\r\nnot properly in a position to seek effects of his own and to make\r\nexperiments. Hardly anything is bought for the galleries, and there are\r\nfew collectors of superior taste. He labours chiefly for the traveller,\r\nand this gives his performances the stamp of attractive mercantile\r\nwares. The Italian is too much a man of business to undertake great\r\ntrials of strength _pour le roi de Prusse_. He paints no great pictures,\r\nwhich would be still-born children in his home, nor does he paint severe\r\nstudies of _plein-air_, preferring a specious, exuberant, flickering,\r\nand glaring revel in colour. In general he produces nothing which will\r\nnot easily sell, and has a fine instinct for the taste of the rich\r\ntravelling public, who wish to see nothing which does not excite\r\ncheerful and superficial emotions.\r\n\r\nBut it is possible that this decline of the Latin races is connected\r\nwith the nature of modern art itself. Of late the words "Germanic" and\r\n"Latin" have been much abused. It has been proclaimed that the new art\r\nmeant the victory of the German depth of feeling over the Latin sense of\r\nform, the onset of German cordiality against the empty exaggeration in\r\nwhich the imitation of the Cinquecento resulted. Such assertions are\r\nalways hard to maintain, because every century shows similar reactions\r\nof truth to nature against mannerism. Nevertheless is it true that\r\nmodern art, with its heartfelt devotion to everyday life and the\r\nmysteries of light, has an essentially Germanic character, finding its\r\nancestors not in Raphael, Michael Angelo, and Titian, but in the English\r\nof the eighteenth, the Dutch of the seventeenth, and the Germans of the\r\nsixteenth century. The Italians and Spaniards, whose entire intellectual\r\nculture rests upon a Latin foundation, may therefore find it difficult\r\nto follow this change of taste. They either adhere to the old bombastic\r\nand theatrical painting of history, or they recast the new painting in\r\nan external drawing-room art draped with gaudy tinsel. Even in France\r\nthe rise of the new art meant, as it were, the victory of the Frankish\r\nelement over the Gallic. Millet the Norman, Courbet the Frank,\r\nBastien-Lepage of Lorraine, drove back the Latins--Ingres and Couture,\r\nCabanel and Bouguereau--just as in the eighteenth century the\r\nNetherlander Watteau broke the yoke of the rigid Latin Classicism.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps no mere chance that the threads of the Germanic aim in art\r\nwere drawn out with such zeal by the Germanic nations. With the Latins\r\na striking effect is made by brilliant technique, mastery of the manual\r\nart of painting, and careless sway over all the enchantments of the\r\ncraft; with the Teutons one stands in the presence of an art which is so\r\nnatural and simple that one scarcely thinks of the means by which it was\r\ncalled into being. In one case there is virtuosity, ductility, and\r\ngrace; in the other, health, intrinsic feeling, and temperament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nTo English painting the acquisitions of the French could now give little\r\nthat was radically novel, for the epoch-making labours of the\r\npre-Raphaelites were already in existence. Apart from certain cases of\r\ndirect borrowing, it has either completely preserved its autonomy, or\r\nrecast everything assimilated from France in a specifically English\r\nfashion. It is in art, indeed, as it is with men themselves. The English\r\ntravel more than any other people, for travel is a part of their\r\neducation. They are to be met in every quarter of the globe--in Africa,\r\nAsia, America, or the European Continent; and they scarcely need to open\r\ntheir mouths, even from a distance, to betray that they are English. In\r\nthe same way there is no need of a catalogue at exhibitions to recognise\r\nall English pictures at the first glance. English painting is too\r\nEnglish not to be fond of travel. The painter delights in reconnoitring\r\nall other schools and studying all styles; he is as much at home in the\r\npast as in the present. But as the English tourist, let him go to the\r\nworld\'s end, retains everywhere his own customs, tastes, and habits, so\r\nEnglish painting, even on its most adventurous journeys, remains\r\nunwaveringly true to its national spirit, and returns from all its\r\nwanderings more English than before; it adapts what is alien with the\r\nsame delicious abnegation of all scruple with which the English tongue\r\nbrings foreign words into harmony with its own sense of convenience. A\r\ncertain softness of feeling and tenderness of spirit induce the English\r\neven in these days to avoid hard contact with reality. Their art rejects\r\neverything in nature which is harsh, rude, and brutal; it is an art\r\nwhich polishes and renders the reality poetic at the risk of\r\ndebilitating its power. It considers matters from the standpoint of what\r\nis pretty, touching, or intelligible, and by no means holds that\r\neverything true is necessarily beautiful. And just as little does the\r\nEnglish eye--so much occupied with detail--see light in its most\r\nexquisite subtleties. Indeed, it rather sees the isolated fact than the\r\ntotal harmony, and is clearer than it is fine.\r\n\r\nFor this reason _plein-air_ painting has very few adepts, and the\r\natmospheric influences which blunt the lines of objects, efface colours,\r\nand bring them nearer to each other, meet with little consideration.\r\nThings are given all the sharpness of their outlines, and the harmony,\r\nwhich in the French follows naturally from the observation of light and\r\nair saturating form and colour, is the more artificially attained by\r\neverything being brought into concord in a bright and delicate tone,\r\nwhich is almost too fine. The audacities of Impressionism are excluded,\r\nbecause painting which starts from a masterly seizure of total effect\r\nwould seem too sketchy to English taste, which has been formed by\r\nRuskin. Painting must be highly finished and highly elaborated; that is\r\na _conditio sine qua non_ which English taste refuses to renounce in\r\noil-painting as little as in water-colour, and in England they are more\r\nclosely related than elsewhere, and have mutually influenced each other\r\nin the matter of technique. In fact, English water-colours seek to rival\r\noil-painting in force and precision, and have therefore forfeited the\r\ncharm of improvisation, the _verve_ of the first sketch, and the\r\nfreshness and ease which they should have by their very character.\r\nThrough a curious change of parts oil-painting has a fancy for borrowing\r\nfrom water-colours their effects and their processes. English pictures\r\nhave no longer anything heavy or oily, but they likewise show nothing of\r\nthe manipulation of the brush, rather resembling large water-colours,\r\nperhaps even pastels or wax-painting. The colours are chosen with\r\nreserve, and everything is subdued and softened like the quiet step of\r\nthe footman in the mansion of a nobleman. The special quality in all\r\nEnglish pictures--putting aside a preference for bright yellow and vivid\r\nred in the older period--consists in a bluish or greenish luminous\r\ngeneral tone, to which every English painter seems to conform as though\r\nit were a binding social convention, and it even recurs in English\r\nlandscapes. In fact, English painting differs from French as England\r\nfrom France.\r\n\r\nFrance is a great city, and the name of this city is Paris. Here, and\r\nnot in the provinces, lives that fashionable, thinking world which has\r\nbecome the guide of the nation and the censor of beauty, by the\r\nrefinement of its taste and its preeminent intellect. The ideas which\r\nfly throughout the land upon invisible wires are born in Paris.\r\nPainting, likewise, receives them at first hand. It stands amid the\r\nseething whirlpool of the age, the heart\'s-blood of the present streams\r\nthrough all its veins, and there is nothing human that is alien to it,\r\nneither the filth nor the splendour of life, its laughter nor its\r\nmisery. All the nerves of the great city are vibrating in it. Paris has\r\nmade her people refined and, at the same time, insatiate in enjoyment.\r\nEvery day they have need of new impressions and new theories to ward off\r\ntedium. And thus is explained the universally comprehensive sphere of\r\nsubject in French painting, and its feverish versatility in technique.\r\n\r\nBut London has, in no sense, the importance for England which Paris has\r\nfor France. It is a centre of attraction for business; but the more\r\nrefined classes of society live in the country. As soon as one is off in\r\nthe Dover express country houses fly past on either side of the train.\r\nThey are all over England--upon the shores of the lakes, upon the strand\r\nof the sea, upon the tops of the hills. And how pleasant they are, how\r\nwell appointed, how delightful to look at, with their gabled roofs and\r\ntheir gleaming brickwork overgrown with ivy! Around them stretches a\r\nfresh lawn which is rolled every morning, as soft as velvet. Fat oxen,\r\nand sheep as white as if they had been just washed, lie upon the grass.\r\nThus all rustic England is like a great summer resort, where there is\r\nheard no sound of the ringing and throbbing strokes of life. Nor is\r\npainting allowed to disturb this idyllic harmony. No one wishes that\r\nanything should remind him of the prose of life when his work is done\r\nand the town has vanished. Schiller\'s assertion, "Life is earnest,\r\nblithe is art," is here the first law of \xc3\xa6esthetics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mag. of Art._   LORD LEIGHTON, P.R.A.]\r\n\r\nEnglish painting is exclusively an art based on luxury, optimism, and\r\naristocracy; in its neatness, cleanliness, and good-breeding it is\r\nexclusively designed to ingratiate itself with English ideas of comfort.\r\nYet the pictures have to satisfy very different tastes--the taste of a\r\nwealthy middle class which wishes to have substantial nourishment, and\r\nthe \xc3\xa6esthetic taste of an _\xc3\xa9lite_ class, which will only tolerate the\r\nquintessence of art, the most subtle art that can be given. But all\r\nthese works are not created for galleries, but for the drawing-room of a\r\nprivate house, and in subject and treatment they have all to reckon with\r\nthe ascendant view that a picture ought, in the first place, to be an\r\nattractive article of furniture for the sitting-room. The traveller, the\r\nlover of antiquity, is pleased by imitation of the ancient style; the\r\nsportsman, the lover of country life, has a delight in little rustic\r\nscenes; and the women are enchanted with feminine types. And everything\r\nmust be kept within the bounds of what is charming, temperate, and\r\nprosperous, without in any degree suggesting the struggle for existence.\r\nThe pictures have themselves the grace of that mundane refinement from\r\nthe midst of which they are beheld.\r\n\r\nEngland is the country of the sculptures of the Parthenon, the country\r\nwhere Bulwer Lytton wrote his _Last Days of Pompeii_, and where the most\r\nGrecian female figures in the world may be seen to move. Thus painters\r\nof antique subjects still play an important part in the pursuit of\r\nEnglish art--probably the pursuit of art rather than its development.\r\nFor they have never enriched the treasury of modern sentiment. Trained,\r\nall of them, in Paris or Belgium, they are equipped with finer taste,\r\nand have acquired abroad a more solid ability than James Barry, Haydon,\r\nand Hinton, the half-barbaric English Classicists of the beginning of\r\nthe century. But at bottom--like Cabanel and Bouguereau--they represent\r\nrigid conservatism in opposition to progress, and the way in which they\r\nset about the reconstruction of an august or domestic antiquity is only\r\ndistinguished by an English _nuance_ of race from that of Couture and\r\nG\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me.\r\n\r\n_Lord Leighton_, the late highly cultured President of the Royal\r\nAcademy, was the most dignified representative of this tendency. He was\r\na Classicist through and through--in the balance of composition, the\r\nrhythmical flow of lines, and the confession of faith that the highest\r\naim of art is the representation of men and women of immaculate build.\r\nIn the picture galleries of Paris, Rome, Dresden, and Berlin he received\r\nhis youthful impressions; his artistic discipline he received under\r\nZanetti in Florence, under Wiertz and Gallait in Brussels, under Steinle\r\nin Frankfort, and under Ingres and Ary Scheffer in Paris. Back in\r\nEngland once more, he translated Couture into English as Anselm\r\nFeuerbach translated him into German with greater independence.\r\nUndoubtedly there has never been anything upon his canvas which could be\r\nsupposed ungentlemanlike. And as a nation is usually apt to prize most\r\nthe very thing which has been denied it, and for which it has no talent,\r\nLeighton was soon an object of admiration to the refined world. As early\r\nas 1864 he became an associate, and in November 1879 President of the\r\nRoyal Academy. For sixteen years he sat like a Jupiter upon his throne\r\nin London. An accomplished man of the world and a good speaker, a\r\nscholar who spoke many languages and had seen many countries, he\r\npossessed every quality which the president of an academy needs to have;\r\nhe had an exceedingly imposing presence in his red gown, and did the\r\nhonours of his house with admirable tact.\r\n\r\nBut one stands before his works with a certain feeling of indifference.\r\nThere are few artists with so little temperament as Lord Leighton, few\r\nin the same degree wanting in the magic of individuality. The purest\r\nacademical art, as the phrase is understood of Ingres, together with\r\nacademical severity of form, is united with a softness of feeling\r\nrecalling Hofmann of Dresden; and the result is a placid classicality\r\nadapted _ad usum Delphini_, a classicality foregoing the applause of\r\nartists, but all the more in accordance with the taste of a refined\r\ncircle of ladies. His chief works, "The Star of Bethlehem," "Orpheus and\r\nEurydice," "Jonathan\'s Token to David," "Electra at the Tomb of\r\nAgamemnon," "The Daphnephoria," "Venus disrobing for the Bath," and the\r\nlike, are amongst the most refined although the most frigid creations of\r\ncontemporary English art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEIGHTON.   CAPTIVE ANDROMACHE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Berlin Photographic Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Portfolio._\r\n\r\n  LEIGHTON.   SIR RICHARD BURTON.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the "Captive Andromache" of 1888 is the quintessence of what he\r\naimed at. The background is the court of an ancient palace, where female\r\nslaves are gathered together fetching water. In the centre of the stage,\r\nas the leading actress, stands Andromache, who has placed her pitcher on\r\nthe ground before her, and waits with dignity until the slaves have\r\nfinished their work. This business of water-drawing has given Leighton\r\nan opportunity for combining an assemblage of beautiful poses. The widow\r\nof Hector expresses a queenly sorrow with decorum, while the\r\namphora-bearers are standing or walking hither and thither, in the\r\nmanner demanded by the pictures upon Grecian vases, but without that\r\nsureness of line which comes of the real observation of life. In its\r\ndignity of style, in the noble composition and purity of the lines which\r\ncircumscribe the forms with so much distinction and in so impersonal a\r\nmanner, the picture is an arid and measured work, cold as marble and\r\nsmooth as porcelain. "Hercules wrestling with Death for the Body of\r\nAlcestis" might be a Grecian relief upon a sarcophagus, so carefully\r\nbalanced are the masses and the lines. The pose of Alcestis is that of\r\nthe nymphs of the Parthenon; only, it would not have been so fine were\r\nthese not in existence. His "Music Lesson" of 1877 is charming, and his\r\n"Elijah in the Wilderness" is a work of style. And in his frescoes in\r\nthe South Kensington Museum there is a perfect compendium of beautiful\r\nmotives of gesture. The eye delights to linger over these feminine\r\nforms, half nude, half enveloped with drapery, yet it notes, too, that\r\nthese creations are composed out of the painter\'s knowledge and artistic\r\nreminiscences; there is a want of life in them, because the master has\r\nsurrendered himself to feeling with the organs of a dead Greek.\r\nLeighton\'s colour is always carefully considered, scrupulously polished,\r\nand endowed with the utmost finish, but it never has the magical charm\r\nby which one recognises the work of a true colourist. It is rather the\r\nresult of painstaking study and cultivated taste than of personal\r\nfeeling. The grace of form is always carefully prepared--a thing which\r\nhas the consciousness of its own existence. Beautiful and spontaneous as\r\nthe movements undoubtedly are, one has always a sense that the artist\r\nis present, anxiously watching lest any of his actors offend against a\r\nlaw of art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  LEIGHTON.   THE LAST WATCH OF HERO.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nLord Leighton\'s pupils, Poynter and Prinsep, followed him with a good\r\ndeal of determination. _Val Prinsep_ shares with Leighton the smooth\r\nforms of a polished painting, whereas _Edward Poynter_ by his more\r\nearnest severity and metallic precision verges more on that union of\r\naridness and style characteristic of Ingres. His masterpiece, "A Visit\r\nto \xc3\x86sculapius," is in point of technique one of the best products of\r\nEnglish Classicism. To the left \xc3\x86sculapius is sitting beneath a pillared\r\nporch overgrown with foliage, while, like Raphael\'s Jupiter in the\r\nFarnesina, he supports his bearded chin thoughtfully with his left hand.\r\nA nymph who has hurt her foot appears, accompanied by three companions,\r\nbefore the throne of the god, begging him for a remedy. To say nothing\r\nof many other nude or nobly draped female figures, numerous decorative\r\npaintings in the Houses of Parliament, St. Paul\'s, and St. Stephen\'s\r\nChurch in Dulwich owe their existence to this most industrious artist.\r\n\r\n_Alma Tadema_, the famous Dutchman who has called to life amid the\r\nLondon fog the sacrifices of Pompeii and Herculaneum, stands to this\r\ngrave academical group as G\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me to Couture. As Bulwer Lytton, in the\r\nfield of literature, created a picture of ancient civilisation so\r\nsuccessful that it has not been surpassed by his followers, Alma Tadema\r\nhas solved the problem of the picture of antique manners in the most\r\nauthentic fashion in the province of painting. He has peopled the past,\r\nrebuilt its towns and refurnished its houses, rekindled the flame upon\r\nthe sacrificial altars and awakened the echo of the dithyrambs to new\r\nlife. Poynter tells old fables, while Alma Tadema takes us in his\r\ncompany, and, like the best-informed cicerone, leads us through the\r\nstreets of old Athens, reconstructing the temples, altars, and\r\ndwellings, the shops of the butchers, bakers, and fishmongers, just as\r\nthey once were.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEIGHTON.   THE BATH OF PSYCHE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Berlin Photographic Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nThis power of making himself believed Alma Tadema owes in the first\r\nplace to his great arch\xc3\xa6ological learning. By Leys in Brussels this side\r\nof his talent was first awakened, and in 1863, when he went to Italy for\r\nthe first time, he discovered his arch\xc3\xa6ological mission. How the old\r\nRomans dressed, how their army was equipped and attired, became as well\r\nknown to him as the appearance of the citizens\' houses, the artizans\'\r\nworkshops, the market and the bath. He explored the ruins of temples,\r\nand he grew familiar with the privileges of the priests, the method of\r\nworship, of the sacrifices, and of the festal processions. There was no\r\nmonument of brass or marble, no wall-painting, no pictured vase nor\r\nmosaic, no sample of ancient arts, of pottery, stone-cutting, or work in\r\ngold, that he did not study. His brain soon became a complete\r\nencyclop\xc3\xa6dia of antiquity. He knew the forms of architecture as well as\r\nhe knew the old myths, and all the domestic appointments and robes as\r\nexactly as the usages of ritual. In Brussels, as early as the sixties,\r\nthis complete power of living in the period he chose to represent gave\r\nAlma Tadema\'s pictures from antiquity their remarkable _cachet_ of\r\nstriking truthfulness to life. And London, whither he migrated in 1870,\r\noffered even a more favourable soil for his art. Whereas the French\r\npainters of the antique picture of manners often fell into a diluted\r\nidealism and a lifeless traffic with old curiosities, with Alma Tadema\r\none stands in the presence of a veritable fragment of life; he simply\r\npaints the people amongst whom he lives and their world. The Pompeian\r\nhouse which he has built in London, with its dreamy vividarium, its\r\ngreat golden hall, its Egyptian decorations, its Ionic pillars, its\r\nmosaic floor, and its Oriental carpets, contains everything one needs to\r\nconjure up the times of Nero and the Byzantine emperors. It is\r\nsurrounded by a garden in the old Roman style, and a large conservatory\r\nadjoining is planted with plane-trees and cypresses. All the celebrated\r\nmarble benches and basins, the figures of stone and bronze, the\r\ntiger-skins and antique vessels and garments of his pictures, may be\r\nfound in this notable house in the midst of London. Whether he paints\r\nthe baths, the amphitheatre, or the atrium, the scenes of his pictures\r\nare no other than parts of his own house which he has faithfully\r\npainted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dixon, photo._\r\n\r\n  POYNTER.   IDLE FEARS.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Lord Hillingdon, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nAnd the figures moving in them are Englishwomen. Among all the beautiful\r\nthings in the world there are few so beautiful as English girls. Those\r\ntall, slender, vigorous figures that one sees upon the beach at Brighton\r\nare really like Greek women, and even the garb which they wear in\r\nplaying tennis is as free and graceful as that of the Grecian people.\r\nAlma Tadema was able to introduce into his works these women of lofty\r\nand noble figure with golden hair, these forms made for sculpture--to\r\nuse the phrase of Winckelmann--without any kind of beautifying idealism.\r\nIn their still-life his pictures are the fruit of enormous arch\xc3\xa6ological\r\nlearning which has become intuitive vision, but his figures are the\r\nresult of a healthy rendering of life. In this way the unrivalled\r\nclassical local colour of his interiors is to be explained, as well as\r\nthe lifelike character of his figures. By his works a remarkable problem\r\nis solved: an intense feeling for modern reality has called the ancient\r\nworld into being in a credible fashion, whilst it has remained\r\nbarricaded against all others who have approached it by the road of\r\nidealism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  POYNTER.   THE IDES OF MARCH.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nIt is only in this method of execution that he still stands upon the\r\nsame ground as G\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me, with whom he shares a taste for anecdote, and a\r\npedantic, neat, and correct style of painting. His ancient comedies\r\nplayed by English actors are an excellent arch\xc3\xa6ological lecture; they\r\nrise above the older picture of antique manners by a more striking\r\nfidelity to nature, very different from the generalisation of the\r\nClassicists\' ideal; yet as a painter he is wanting in every quality. His\r\nmarble shines, his bronze gleams, and everything is harmonised with the\r\ngreen of the cypresses and delicate rose-colour of the oleander blossoms\r\nin a cool marble tone; but there is also something marble in the figures\r\nthemselves. He draws and stipples, works like a copper engraver, and\r\ngoes over his work again and again with a fine and feeble brush. His\r\npictures have the effect of porcelain, his colours are hard and\r\nlifeless. One remembers the anecdotes, but one cannot speak of any idea\r\nof colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dixon, photo._\r\n\r\n  POYNTER.   A VISIT TO \xc3\x86SCULAPIUS.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Berlin Photographic Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  ALMA TADEMA.   SAPPHO.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Berlin Photographic Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\n_Albert Moore_ is to be noted as the solitary "painter" of the group: a\r\nvery delicate artist, with a style peculiar to himself; one who is not\r\nso well known upon the Continent as he deserves to be. His province,\r\nalso, is ancient Greece, yet he never attempted to reconstruct classical\r\nantiquity as a learned arch\xc3\xa6ologist. Merely as a painter did he love to\r\ndream amid the imperishable world of beauty known to ancient times. His\r\nfigures are ethereal visions, and move in dreamland. He was influenced,\r\nindeed, by the sculptures of the Parthenon, but the Japanese have also\r\npenetrated his spirit. From the Greeks he learnt the combination of\r\nnoble lines, the charm of dignity and quietude, while the Japanese gave\r\nhim the feeling for harmonies of colour, for soft, delicate, blended\r\ntones. By a capricious union of both these elements he formed his\r\nrefined and exquisite style. The world which he has called into being is\r\nmade up of white marble pillars; in its gardens are cool fountains and\r\nmarble pavements; but it is also full of white birds, soft colours, and\r\nrosy blossoms from Kioto, and peopled with graceful and mysterious\r\nmaidens, clothed in ideal draperies, who love rest, enjoy an eternal\r\nyouth, and are altogether contented with themselves and with one\r\nanother. It might be said that the old figures of Tanagra had received\r\nnew life, were it not felt, at the same time, that these beings must\r\nhave drunk a good deal of tea. Not that they are entirely modern, for\r\ntheir figures are more plastic and symmetrical than those of the actual\r\ndaughters of Albion; but in all their movements they have a certain\r\n_chic_, and in all their shades of expression a weary modernity, through\r\nwhich they deviate from the conventional woman of Classicism. Otherwise\r\nthe pictures of Albert Moore are indescribable. Frail, ethereal beings,\r\nblond as corn, lounge in \xc3\xa6esthetically graduated grey and blue,\r\nsalmon-coloured, or pale purple draperies upon bright-hued couches\r\ndecorated by Japanese artists with most \xc3\xa6sthetic materials; or are\r\nstanding in violet robes with white mantles embroidered with gold, by a\r\ngrey-blue sea which has a play of greenish tones where it breaks upon\r\nthe shore. They stand out with their rosy garments from the light grey\r\nbackground and the delicate arabesques of a gleaming silvery gobelin, or\r\nin a graceful pose occupy themselves with their rich draperies. They do\r\nas little as they possibly can, but they are living and seductive, and\r\nthe stuffs which they wear and have around them are delicately and\r\ncharmingly painted. It is harmonies of tone and colour that exclusively\r\nform the subject of every work. The figures, accessories, and detail\r\nfirst take shape when the scheme of colour has been found; and then\r\nAlbert Moore takes a delight in naming his pictures "Apricots,"\r\n"Oranges," "Shells," etc., according as the robes are apricot or orange\r\ncolour or adorned with light ornaments of shell. Everything which comes\r\nfrom his hands is delightful in the charm of delicate simplicity, and\r\nfor any one who loves painting as painting it has something soothing in\r\nthe midst of the surrounding art, which still confuses painting with\r\npoetry more than is fitting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mansell Photo._\r\n\r\n  ALMA TADEMA.   A VISIT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Scribner._   ALBERT MOORE.]\r\n\r\nSuch a painter-poet of the specifically English type is\r\n_Briton-Rivi\xc3\xa8re_. He is a painter of animals, and as such one of the\r\ngreatest of the century. Lions and geese, royal tigers and golden\r\neagles, stags, dogs, foxes, Highland cattle, he has painted them all,\r\nand with a mastery which has nothing like it except in Landseer. Amongst\r\nthe painters of animals he stands alone through his power of conception\r\nand his fine poetic vein, while in all his pictures he unites the\r\ngreatest simplicity with enormous dramatic force. Accessory work is\r\neverywhere kept within the narrowest limits, and everywhere the\r\ncharacter of the animals is magnificently grasped. He does not alone\r\npaint great tragic scenes as Barye chiselled them, for he knows that\r\nbeasts of prey are usually quiet and peaceable, and only now and then\r\nobey their savage nature. Moreover, he never attempts to represent\r\nanimals performing a masquerade of humanity in their gestures and\r\nexpression, as Landseer did, nor does he transform them into comic\r\nactors. He paints them as what they are, a symbol of what humanity was\r\nonce itself, with its elemental passions and its natural virtues and\r\nfailings. Amongst all animal painters he is almost alone in resisting\r\nthe temptation to give the lion a consciousness of his own dignity, the\r\ntiger a consciousness of his own savageness, the dog a consciousness of\r\nhis own understanding. They neither pose nor think about themselves. In\r\naddition to this he has a powerful and impressive method, and a deep and\r\nearnest scheme of colour. In the beginning of his career he learnt most\r\nfrom James Ward. Later he felt the influence of the refined, chivalrous,\r\nand piquant Scotchmen Orchardson and Pettie. But the point in which\r\nBriton-Rivi\xc3\xa8re is altogether peculiar is that in which he joins issue\r\nwith the painters influenced by Greece: he introduces his animals into a\r\nscene where there are men of the ancient world.\r\n\r\nBriton-Rivi\xc3\xa8re is descended from a French family which found its way\r\ninto England after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and he is one\r\nof those painters--so frequent in English art--whose nature has\r\ndeveloped early: when he was fourteen he left school, exhibited in the\r\nAcademy when he was eighteen, painted as a pre-Raphaelite between the\r\nages of eighteen and twenty-two, and graduated at Oxford at\r\nseven-and-twenty. In his youth he divided his time between art and\r\nscholarship--painting pictures and studying Greek and Latin literature.\r\nThus he became a painter of animals, having also an enthusiasm for the\r\nGreek poets, and he has stood for a generation as an uncontested lord\r\nand master on his own peculiar ground. In his first important picture,\r\nof 1871, the comrades of Ulysses, changed into swine, troop grunting\r\nround the enchantress Circe. In the masterpiece of 1872 the Prophet\r\nDaniel stands unmoved and submissive to the will of God amid the lions\r\nroaring and showing their teeth, ready to spring upon him in their\r\nhunger, yet regarding him with a mysterious fear, spellbound by the\r\npower of his eye; while his great picture "Persepolis" makes the appeal\r\nof a page from the philosophy of history, with its lions roaming\r\nmajestically amid the ruins of human grandeur and human civilisation,\r\nwhich are flooded with moonlight. The picture "In Manus Tuas, Domine,"\r\nshowed St. George riding solitary through the lonely and silent recesses\r\nof a primitive forest upon a pale white horse. He is armed in mail and\r\nhas a mighty sword; a deep seriousness is imprinted on his features, for\r\nhe has gone forth to slay the dragon. In yet another picture, "An\r\nOld-World Wanderer," a man of the early ages has come ashore upon an\r\nuntrodden island, and is encompassed by flocks of great white birds,\r\nfluttering round him with curiosity and confidence, as yet ignorant of\r\nthe fear of human beings. The picture of 1891, "A Mighty Hunter before\r\nthe Lord," is one of his most poetic night-pieces: Nimrod is returning\r\nhome, and beneath the silvery silence of the moon the dead and dying\r\ncreatures which he has laid low upon the wide Assyrian plain are tended\r\nand bemoaned by their mates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Scribner._\r\n\r\n  ALBERT MOORE.   MIDSUMMER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Cadbury, Jones & Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALBERT MOORE.   COMPANIONS.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Dowdeswell & Dowdeswells, the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nBetween whiles he painted subjects which were not borrowed from ancient\r\nhistory, illustrating the friendship between man and dog, as Landseer\r\nhad done before him. For instance, in "His Only Friend" there is a poor\r\nlad who has broken down at the last milestone before the town and is\r\nguarded by his dog. In "Old Playfellows," again, one of the playmates is\r\na child, who is sick and leans back quietly in an armchair covered with\r\ncushions. His friend the great dog has one paw resting on the child\'s\r\nlap, and looks up with a pensive expression, such as Landseer alone had\r\npreviously painted. But in this style he reached his highest point in\r\n"Sympathy." No work of Briton-Rivi\xc3\xa8re\'s has become more popular than\r\nthis picture of the little maiden who has forgotten her key and is\r\nsitting helpless before the house-door, consoled by the dog who has laid\r\nhis head upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Scribner._\r\n\r\n  ALBERT MOORE.   YELLOW MARGUERITES.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of W. Connal, Esq., the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nSince the days of Reynolds English art has shown a most vivid\r\noriginality in such representations of children. English picture-books\r\nfor children are in these days the most beautiful in the world, and the\r\nmarvellous fairy-tales and fireside stories of _Randolph Caldecott_ and\r\n_Kate Greenaway_ have made their way throughout the whole Continent. How\r\nwell these English draughtsmen know the secret of combining truth with\r\nthe most exquisite grace! How touching are these pretty babies, how\r\nangelically innocent these little maidens! Frank eyes, blue as the\r\nflowers of the periwinkle, gaze at you with no thought of their being\r\nlooked at in return. The na\xc3\xafve astonishment of the little ones, their\r\nfrightened mien, their earnest look absently fixed upon the sky, the\r\nfirst tottering steps of a tiny child and the mobile grace of a\r\nschoolgirl, all are rendered in these prints with the most tender\r\nintimacy of feeling. And united with this there is a delicate and\r\nentirely modern sentiment for scenery, for the fascination of bare\r\nautumn landscapes robbed of their foliage, for sunbeams and the budding\r\nfragrance of spring. Everything is idyllic, poetic, and touched by a\r\ncongenial breath of tender melancholy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Scribner._\r\n\r\n  ALBERT MOORE.   WAITING TO CROSS.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Lord Davey, the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nAnd this aerial quality, this delicacy and innocent grace and\r\ntenderness, is not confined alone to such representations of children,\r\nbut is peculiar to English painting. Even when perfectly ordinary\r\nsubjects from modern life are in question the basis of this art is, as\r\nin the first half of the century, by no means the sense for what is\r\npurely pictorial, by no means that naturalistic pantheism which inspires\r\nthe modern French, but rather a sense for what is moral or ethical. The\r\npainter seldom paints merely for the joy of painting, and the numberless\r\ntechnical questions which play such an important part in French art are\r\nhere only of secondary importance. It accords with the character and\r\ntaste of the people that their artists have rather a poetic design than\r\none which is properly pictorial. The conception is sometimes allegorical\r\nand subtle to the most exquisite fineness of point, sometimes it is\r\nvitiated by sentimentality, but it is never purely naturalistic; and\r\nthis qualified realism, this realism with a poetic strain to keep it\r\nladylike, set English art, especially in the years when Bastien-Lepage\r\nand Roll were at their zenith, in sharp opposition to the art of France.\r\nIn those days the life-size artisan picture, the prose of life, and the\r\nstruggle for existence reigned almost exclusively in the Parisian Salon,\r\nwhereas in the Royal Academy everything was quiet and cordial; an\r\nintimate, inoffensive, and heartfelt cheerfulness was to be found in the\r\npictures upon its walls, as if none of these painters knew of the\r\nexistence of such a place as Whitechapel. A connection between pictures\r\nand poems is still popular, and some touching trait, some tender\r\nepisode, some expression of softness, is given to subjects drawn from\r\nthe ordinary life of the people. Painters seek in every direction after\r\npretty rustic scenes, moving incidents, or pure emotions. Instead of\r\nbeing harsh and rugged in their sense of truth and passion, they glide\r\nlightly away from anything ugly, bringing together the loveliest and\r\nmost beautiful things in nature, and creating elegies, pastorals, and\r\nidylls from the passing events of life. Their method of expression is\r\nfastidious and finished to a nicety; their vision of life is smiling and\r\nkindly, though it must not be supposed that their optimism has now\r\nanything in common with the _genre_ picture of 1850. The _genre_\r\npainters from Wilkie to Collins epitomised the actual manners of the\r\npresent in prosaic compositions. But here the most splendid poetry\r\nbreaks out, as indeed it actually does in the midst of ordinary life. If\r\nin that earlier period English painting was awkward in narration,\r\nvulgar, and didactic, it is now tasteful, refined, beautiful, and of\r\ndistinction. The philistinism of the pictures of those days has been\r\nfinally stripped away, and the humorously anecdotic _genre_ entirely\r\novercome. The generation of tiresome narrative artists has been followed\r\nby painter-poets of delicacy and exquisite tenderness of feeling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Scribner._\r\n\r\n  ALBERT MOORE.   READING ALOUD.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of W. Connal, Esq., the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nTwo masters who died young and have a peculiarly captivating\r\nindividuality, George Mason and Fred Walker, stand at the head of this,\r\nthe most novel phase of English painting. Alike in the misfortune of\r\npremature death, they are also united by a bond of sympathy in their\r\ntaste and sentiment. If there be truth in what Th\xc3\xa9ophile Gautier once\r\nsaid in a beautiful poem, "_Tout passe, l\'art robuste seul a\r\nl\'\xc3\xa9ternit\xc3\xa9_," neither of them will enter the kingdom of immortality.\r\nThat might be applied to them which Heine said of Leopold Robert: they\r\nhave purified the peasant in the purgatory of their art, so that nothing\r\nbut a glorified body remains. As the pre-Raphaelites wished to give\r\nexquisite precision to the world of dream, Walker and Mason have taken\r\nthis precision from the world of reality, endowing it with a refined\r\nsubtlety which in truth it does not possess. Their pictures breathe only\r\nof the bloom and essence of things, and in them nature is deprived of\r\nher strength and marrow, and painting of her peculiar qualities, which\r\nare changed into coloured breath and tinted dream. They may be\r\nreproached with an excess of nervous sensibility, an effort after style\r\nby which modern truth is recast, a morbid tendency towards suave\r\nmysticism. Nevertheless their works are the most original products of\r\nEnglish painting during the last thirty years, and by a strange union of\r\nrealism and poetic feeling they have exercised a deeply penetrative\r\ninfluence upon Continental art.\r\n\r\n"_\xc3\x86quam semper in rebus arduis servare mentem_" might be chosen as a\r\nmotto for _George Mason\'s_ biography. Brought up in prosperous\r\ncircumstances, he first became a doctor, but when he was\r\nseven-and-twenty he went to Italy to devote himself to painting; here he\r\nreceived the news that he was ruined. His father had lost everything,\r\nand he found himself entirely deprived of means, so that his life became\r\na long struggle against hunger. He bound himself to dealers, and\r\nprovided animal pieces by the dozen for the smallest sums. In a freezing\r\nroom he sat with his pockets empty, worked until it was dark, and crept\r\ninto bed when Rome went to feast. After two years, however, he had at\r\nlast saved the money necessary for taking him back to England, and he\r\nsettled with his young wife in Wetley Abbey. This little village, where\r\nhe lived his simple life in the deepest seclusion, became for him what\r\nBarbizon had been for Millet. He wandered by himself amongst the fields,\r\nand painted the valleys of Wetley with the tenderness of feeling with\r\nwhich Corot painted the outskirts of Fontainebleau. He saw the ghostly\r\nmists lying upon the moors, saw the peasants returning from the plough\r\nand the reapers from the field, noted the children, in their life so\r\nclosely connected with the change of nature. And yet his peasant\r\npictures more resemble the works of Perugino than those of\r\nBastien-Lepage. The character of their landscape is to some extent\r\nresponsible for this. For the region he paints, in its lyrical charm,\r\nhas kinship with the hills in the pictures of Perugino. Here there grow\r\nthe same slender trees upon a delicate, undulating soil. But the silent,\r\npeaceful, and resigned human beings who move across it have also the\r\ntender melancholy of Umbrian Madonnas. Mason\'s realism is merely\r\nspecious; it consists in the external point of costume. There are really\r\nno peasants of such slender growth, no English village maidens with such\r\nrosy faces and such coquettish Holland caps. Mason divests them of all\r\nthe heaviness of earth, takes, as it were, only the flower-dust from\r\nreality. The poetic grace of Jules Breton might be recalled, were it not\r\nthat Mason works with more refinement and subtlety, for his idealism was\r\nunconscious, and never resulted in an empty, professional painting of\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  CALDECOTT.   THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nWhen he painted his finest pictures he suffered from very bad health,\r\nand his works have themselves the witchery of disease, the fascinating\r\nbeauty of consumption. He painted with such delicacy and refinement,\r\nbecause sickness had made him weak and delicate; he divested his peasant\r\nmen and women of everything fleshly, so that nothing but a shadow of\r\nthem remained, a spirit vibrating in fine, elusive, dying chords. In his\r\n"Evening Hymn" girls are singing in the meadow; to judge from their\r\ndresses, they should be the daughters of the peasantry, but one fancies\r\nthem religious enthusiasts, brought together upon this mysterious and\r\nsequestered corner of the earth by a melancholy world-weariness, by a\r\nyearning after the mystical. Fragile as glass, sensitive to the ends of\r\ntheir fingers, and, one might say, morbidly spiritual, they breathe out\r\ntheir souls in song, encompassed by the soft shadows of the evening\r\ntwilight, and uttering all the exquisite tenderness of their subtle\r\ntemperament in the hymn they chant. Another of his pastoral symphonies\r\nis "The Harvest Moon." Farm labourers are plodding homewards after their\r\nday\'s work. The moon is rising, and casts its soft, subdued light upon\r\nthe dark hills and the slender trees, in the silvery leaves of which the\r\nevening wind is playing. "The Gander," "The Young Anglers," and "The\r\nCast Shoe" are captivating through the same delicacy and the same mood\r\nof peaceful resignation. George Mason is an astonishing artist, almost\r\nalways guilty of exaggeration, but always seductive. Life passes in his\r\npictures like a beautiful summer\'s day, and with the accompaniment of\r\nsoft music. A peaceful, delicate feeling, something mystical,\r\nbitter-sweet, and suffering, lives beneath the light and tender veil of\r\nhis pictures. They affect the nerves like a harmonica, and lull one with\r\nlow and softly veiled harmonies. Many of the melancholy works of Israels\r\nhave a similar effect, only Israels is less refined, has less of\r\ndistinction and--more of truth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MASON.   THE END OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n  (_By gracious permission of H.M. Queen Victoria, the owner of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nThis suavity of feeling is characteristic in an almost higher degree of\r\n_Fred Walker_, a sensitive artist never satisfied with himself. Every\r\none of his pictures gives the impression of deep and quiet reverie;\r\neverywhere a kind of mood, like that in a fairy tale, colours the\r\nordinary events of life in his works, an effect produced by his refined\r\ncomposition of forms and colours. In his classically simple art Mason\r\nwas influenced by the Italians, and especially the Umbrians. Walker drew\r\na similar inspiration from the works of Millet. Both the Englishman and\r\nthe Frenchman died in the same year, the former on 20th January 1875, in\r\nBarbizon, the latter on 5th June, in Scotland; and yet in a certain\r\nsense they stand at the very opposite poles of art. Walker is graceful,\r\ndelicate, and tender; Millet forceful, healthy, and powerful. "To draw\r\nsublimity from what is trivial" was the aim of both, and they both\r\nreached it by the same path. All their predecessors had held truth as\r\nthe foe of beauty, and had qualified shepherds and shepherdesses,\r\nploughmen and labourers, for artistic treatment by forcing upon them the\r\nsmiling grace and the strained humour of _genre_ painting. Millet and\r\nFred Walker broke with the frivolity of this elder school of painting,\r\nwhich had seen matter for jesting, and only that, in the life of the\r\nrustic; they asserted that in the life of the toiler nothing was more\r\ndeserving of artistic representation than his toil. They always began by\r\nreproducing life as they saw it, and by disdaining, in their effort\r\nafter truth, all artificial embellishment; they came to recognise, both\r\nof them at the same time, a dignity in the human frame, and grandiose\r\nforms and classic lines in human movement, which no one had discovered\r\nbefore. With the most pious reverence for the exact facts of life, there\r\nwas united that greatness of conception which is known as style.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  WALKER.   THE BATHERS.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Thomas Agnew & Sons, the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nFred Walker, the Tennyson of painting, was born in London in 1840, and\r\nhad scarcely left school before the galleries of ancient art in the\r\nBritish Museum became his favourite place of resort. Drawings for\r\nwood-engraving were his first works, and with Millet in France he has\r\nthe chief merit of having put fresh life into the traditional style of\r\nEnglish wood engraving, so that he is honoured by the young school of\r\nwood-engravers as their lord and master. His first, and as yet\r\nunimportant, drawings appeared in 1860 in a periodical called _Once a\r\nWeek_, for which Leech, Millais, and others also made drawings. Shortly\r\nafter this _d\xc3\xa9but_ he was introduced to Thackeray, then the editor of\r\n_Cornhill_, and he undertook the illustrations with Millais. In these\r\nplates he is already seen in his charm, grace, and simplicity. His\r\nfavourite season is the tender spring, when the earth is clothed with\r\nyoung verdure, and the sunlight glances over the naked branches, and\r\nthe children pluck the first flowers which have shot up beneath their\r\ncovering of snow.\r\n\r\nHis pictures give pleasure by virtue of the same qualities--delicacy of\r\ndrawing, bloom of colouring, and a grace which is not affected in spite\r\nof its Grecian rhythm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  BOUGHTON.   GREEN LEAVES AMONG THE SERE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nWalker was the first to introduce that delicate rosy red which has since\r\nbeen popular in English painting. His method of vision is as widely\r\nremoved from that of Manet as from Couture\'s brown sauce. The surface of\r\nevery one of his pictures resembles a rare jewel in its delicate finish:\r\nit is soft, and gives the sense of colour and of refined and soothing\r\nharmony. His first important work, "Bathers," was exhibited in 1867 at\r\nthe Royal Academy, where works of his appeared regularly during the next\r\nfive years. About a score of young people are standing on the verge of a\r\ndeep and quiet English river, and are just about to refresh themselves\r\nin the tide after a hot August day. Some, indeed, are already in the\r\nwater, while others are sitting upon the grass and others undressing.\r\nThe frieze of the Parthenon is recalled, so plastic is the grace of\r\nthese young frames, and the style and repose of the treatment of lines,\r\nwhich are such as may only be found in Puvis de Chavannes. In his next\r\npicture, "The Vagrants," he represented a group of gipsies camping round\r\na fire in the midst of an English landscape. A mother is nursing her\r\nchild, while to the left a woman is standing plunged in thought, and to\r\nthe right a lad is throwing wood upon the faintly blazing fire. Here,\r\ntoo, the figures are all drawn severely after nature and yet have the\r\nair of Greek statues. There is no modern artist who has united in so\r\nunforced a manner actuality and fidelity to nature with "the noble\r\nsimplicity and quiet grandeur" of the antique. In a succeeding picture\r\nof 1870, "The Plough," a labourer is striding over the ground behind the\r\nplough. The long day is approaching its end, and the moon stands silvery\r\nin the sky. Far into the distance the field stretches away, and the\r\nheavy tread of the horses mingles in the stillness of evening with the\r\nmurmur of the stream which flows round the grassy ridge, making its soft\r\ncomplaint. "Man goeth forth to his work and to his labour until the\r\nevening" is its thoroughly English motto. The same still mournfulness of\r\nsunset he painted in that work of marvellous tenderness, "The Old Gate."\r\nThe peace of dusk is resting upon a soft and gentle landscape. A lady\r\nwho is the owner of a country mansion and is dressed like a widow has\r\njust stepped out from the garden gate, accompanied by her maid, who is\r\nin the act of shutting it; children are playing on the steps, and a\r\ncouple of labourers are going past in front and look towards the lady of\r\nthe house. It is nothing except the meeting of certain persons, a scene\r\nsuch as takes place every day, and yet even here there is a subtlety and\r\ntenderness which raise the event from the prose of ordinary life into a\r\nmysterious world of poetry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  BOUGHTON.   SNOW IN SPRING.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nIn his later period he deviated more and more towards a fragrant\r\nlyricism. In his great picture of 1872, "The Harbour of Refuge," the\r\nbackground is formed by one of those peaceful buildings where the aged\r\npoor pass the remainder of their days in meditative rest. The sun is\r\nsinking, and there is a rising moon. The red-tiled roof stands out clear\r\nagainst the quiet evening sky, while upon the terrace in front, over\r\nwhich the tremulous yellow rays of the setting sun are shed, an old\r\nwoman with a bowed figure is walking, guided by a graceful girl who\r\nsteps lightly forward. It is the old contrast between day and night,\r\nyouth and age, strength and decay. Yet in Walker there is no opposition\r\nafter all. For as light mingles with the shadows in the twilight, this\r\nyoung and vigorous woman who paces in the evening, holding the arm of\r\nthe aged in mysterious silence, has at the moment no sense of her youth,\r\nbut is rather filled with that melancholy thought underlying Goethe\'s\r\n"_Warte nur balde_," "Wait awhile and thou shalt rest too." Her eyes\r\nhave a strange gaze, as though she were looking into vacancy in mere\r\nabsence of mind. And upon the other side of the picture this theme of\r\nthe transient life of humanity is still further developed. Upon a bench\r\nin the midst of a verdant lawn covered with daisies a group of old men\r\nare sitting meditatively near a hedge of hawthorn luxuriant in blossom.\r\nAbove the bench there stands an old statue casting a clearly defined\r\nshadow upon the gravel path, as if to point to the contrast between\r\nimperishable stone and the unstable race of men, fading away like the\r\nautumn leaves. Well in the foreground a labourer is mowing down the\r\ntender spring grass with a scythe--a strange, wild, and rugged figure, a\r\nreaper whose name is Death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  BOUGHTON.   A BREATH OF WIND.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nIt was not long before evening drew on for the painter, and Death, the\r\nmighty reaper, laid him low.\r\n\r\nOf a nervous and sensitive temperament, Walker had one of those natures\r\nwhich find their way with difficulty through this rude world of fact.\r\nThose little things which he had the art of painting so beautifully, and\r\nwhich occupy such an important place in his work, had, in another sense,\r\nmore influence upon his life than ought to have been the case. While\r\nMason faced all unpleasantnesses with stoical indifference, Walker\r\nallowed himself to be disturbed and hindered in his work by every\r\nfailure and every sharp wind of criticism. In addition to that he was,\r\nlike Mason, a victim of consumption. A residence in Algiers merely\r\nbanished the insidious disease for a short time. Amongst the last works,\r\nwhich he exhibited in 1875, a considerable stir was made by a drawing\r\ncalled "The Unknown Land": a vessel with naked men is drawing near the\r\nshores of a wide and peaceful island bathed in a magical light. Soon\r\nafterwards Walker had himself departed to that unknown land: he died in\r\nScotland when he was five-and-thirty. His body was brought to the little\r\nchurchyard at Cookham on the banks of the Thames. In this village Fred\r\nWalker is buried amid the fair river landscape which he so loved and so\r\noften painted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  BOUGHTON.   THE BEARERS OF THE BURDEN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nAfter the pre-Raphaelite revolution, the foundation of the school of\r\nWalker indicated the last stage of English art. His influence was far\r\ngreater than might be supposed from the small number of his works, and\r\nfifty per cent. of the English pictures in every exhibition would\r\nperhaps never have been painted if he had not been born. A national\r\nelement long renounced, that old English sentiment which once inspired\r\nthe landscapes of Gainsborough and the scenes of Morland, and was lost\r\nin the hands of Wilkie and the _genre_ painters, lives once more in Fred\r\nWalker. He adapted it to the age by adding something of Tennyson\'s\r\npassion for nature. There is a touch of symbolism in that old gate which\r\nhe painted in the beautiful picture of 1870. He and Mason opened it so\r\nthat English art might pass into this new domain, where musical\r\nsentiment is everything, where one is buried in sweet reveries at the\r\nsight of a flock of geese driven by a young girl, or a labourer stepping\r\nbehind his plough, or a child playing, free from care, with pebbles at\r\nthe water\'s edge. Their disciples are perhaps healthier, or, should one\r\nsay, "less refined,"--in other words, not quite so sensitive and\r\nhyper-\xc3\xa6sthetic as those who opened the old gate. They seem physically\r\nmore robust, and can better face the sharp air of reality. They no\r\nlonger dissolve painting altogether into music and poetry; they live\r\nmore in the world at every hour, not merely when the sun is setting, but\r\nalso when the prosaic daylight exposes objects in their material\r\nheaviness. But the tender ground-tone, the effort to seize nature in\r\nsoft phases, is the same in all. Like bees, they suck from reality only\r\nits sweets. The earnest, tender, and deeply heartfelt art of Walker has\r\ninfluenced them all.\r\n\r\nEvening when work is over, the end of summer, twilight, autumn, the pale\r\nand golden sky, and the dead leaves are the things which have probably\r\nmade the most profound impression on the English spirit. The hour when\r\ntoil is laid aside, and rest begins and people seek their homes, and the\r\nseason when fires are first lighted are the hour and the season most\r\nbeloved by this people, which, with all its rude energy, is yet so\r\ntender and full of feeling. Repose to the point of enervation and the\r\nstage where it passes into gentle melancholy is the theme of their\r\npictures--this, and not toil.\r\n\r\nHow many have been painted in the last forty years in which people are\r\nreturning from their work of an evening across the country! The people\r\nin the big towns look upon the country with the eyes of a lover,\r\nespecially those parts of it which lie near the town; not the scenes\r\npainted by Raffaelli, but the parks and public gardens. Soft, undulating\r\nvalleys and gently swelling hills are spread around, the flowers are in\r\nbloom, and the leaves glance in the sunshine. And over this country,\r\nwith its trim gravel paths and its green, luxuriant lawns, there comes a\r\nwell-to-do people. Even the labourers seem in good case as they go home\r\nacross the flowery meadows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  J. R. REID.   TOIL AND PLEASURE.]\r\n\r\n_George H. Boughton_ was one of the most graceful and refined amongst\r\nWalker\'s followers. By birth and descent a countryman of Crome and\r\nCotman, he passed his youth in America, worked several years in Paris\r\nfrom 1853, and in 1863 settled in London, where he was exceedingly\r\nactive as a draughtsman, a writer, and a painter. His charming\r\nillustrations for _Harper\'s Magazine_, where he also published his\r\ndelicate story _The Return of the Mayflower_, are well known. As a\r\npainter, too, his brush was only occupied by pleasant things, whether\r\nbelonging to the past or the present. There is something in him both of\r\nthe delicacy of Gainsborough and of the poetry of Memlinc. He delights\r\nin the murmur of brooks and the rustle of leaves, in fresh children and\r\npretty young women in \xc3\xa6esthetically fantastic costume; he loves\r\neverything delicate, quiet, and fragrant. And for this reason he also\r\ntakes delight in old legends entwined with blossoms, and attains a most\r\nharmonious effect when he places shepherds and kings\' daughters of\r\nstory, and steel-clad knights and squires in his charming and entirely\r\nmodern landscapes. Almost always it is autumn, winter, or at most the\r\nearly spring in his pictures. The boughs of the trees are generally\r\nbare, though sometimes a tender pointed yellowish verdure is budding\r\nupon them. At times the mist of November hovers over the country like a\r\ndelicate veil; at times the snowflakes fall softly, or the October sun\r\ngleams through the leafless branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANK HOLL.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, a feeling for the articulation of lines, for a balance of\r\ncomposition, unforced, and yet giving a character of distinction, is\r\npeculiar to him in a high degree. In 1877 he had in the Royal Academy\r\nthe charming picture "A Breath of Wind." Amid a soft landscape with\r\nslender trees move the thoroughly Grecian figures of the shapely English\r\npeasants, whilst the tender evening light is shed over the gently rising\r\nhills. His picture of 1878 he named "Green Leaves among the Sere": a\r\ngroup of children, in the midst of whom the young mother herself looks\r\nlike a child, are seated amid an autumn landscape, where the leaves\r\nfall, and the sky is shrouded in wintry grey. In the picture "Snow in\r\nSpring" may be seen a party of charming girls--little modern Tanagra\r\nfigures--whom the sun has tempted into the air to search for the\r\nearliest woodland snowdrops under the guidance of a damsel still in her\r\n\'teens. Having just reached a secret corner of the wood, they are\r\nstanding with their flowers in their hands surrounded by tremulous\r\nboughs, when a sudden snowstorm overtakes them. Thick white flakes\r\nalight upon the slender boughs, and combine with the light green leaves\r\nand pale reddish dresses of the children in making a delicate harmony of\r\ncolour. Among his legendary pictures the poetic "Love Conquers all\r\nThings," in particular is known in Germany: a wild shepherd\'s daughter\r\nsits near her flock, and the son of a king gazes into her eyes lost in\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLL.   "THE LORD GAVE, THE LORD HATH TAKEN AWAY; BLESSED\r\n  BE THE NAME OF THE LORD."\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of E. C. Pawle, Esq., the owner of the picture._)]\r\n\r\nBoughton is not the only painter of budding girlhood. All English\r\nliterature has a tender feminine trait. Tennyson is the poet most widely\r\nread, and he has won all hearts chiefly through his portraits of women:\r\nAdeline, Ele\xc3\xa4nore, Lilian, and the May Queen--that delightful gallery of\r\npure and noble figures. In English painting, too, it is seldom men who\r\nare represented, but more frequently women and children, especially\r\nlittle maidens in their fresh pure witchery.\r\n\r\nBelonging still to the older period there is _Philip H. Calderon_, an\r\nexceedingly fertile although lukewarm and academical artist, in whose\r\nblood is a good deal of effeminate Classicism. When his name appears in\r\na catalogue it means that the spectator will be led into an artificial\r\nregion peopled with pretty girls--beings who are neither sad nor gay,\r\nand who belong neither to the present nor to ancient times, to no age in\r\nparticular and to no clime. Whenever such ethereal girlish figures wear\r\nthe costume of the Directoire period, _Marcus Stone_ is their father. He\r\nis likewise one of the older men whose first appearance was made before\r\nthe time of Walker. His young ladies part broken-hearted from a beloved\r\nsuitor, turned away by their father, and save the honour of their\r\nfamily by giving their hand to a wealthy but unloved aspirant, or else\r\nthey are solitary and lost in tender reveries. In his earliest period\r\nMarcus Stone had a preference for interiors; rich Directoire furniture\r\nand objects of art indicate with exactness the year in which the\r\nnarrative takes place. Later, he took a delight in placing his _rococo_\r\nladies and gentlemen in the open air, upon the terraces of old gardens\r\nor in sheltered alleys. All his pictures are pretty, the faces, the\r\nfigures, and the accessories; in relation to them one may use the\r\nadjective "pretty" in its positive, comparative, or superlative degree.\r\nIn England Marcus Stone is the favourite painter of "sweethearts," and\r\nit cannot be easy to go so near the boundaries of candied _genre_\r\npainting and yet always to preserve a certain _noblesse_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L\'Art._\r\n\r\n  HOLL.   LEAVING HOME.]\r\n\r\nAmongst later artists _G. D. Leslie_, the son of Charles Leslie, has\r\nspecially the secret of interpreting innocent feminine beauty, that\r\nsomewhat predetermined but charming grace derived from Gainsborough and\r\nthe eighteenth century. A young lady who has lately been married is\r\npaying a visit to her earlier school friends, and is gazed upon as\r\nthough she were an angel by these charming girls. Or his pretty maidens\r\nhave ensconced themselves beneath the trees, or stand on the shore\r\nwatching a boat at sunset, or amuse themselves from a bridge in a park\r\nby throwing flowers into the water and looking dreamily after them as\r\nthey float away. Leslie\'s pictures, too, are very pretty and poetic, and\r\nhave much silk in them and much sun, while the soft pale method of\r\npainting, so highly \xc3\xa6sthetic in its delicate attenuation of colour,\r\ncorresponds with the delicacy of their purport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLL.   ORDERED TO THE FRONT.]\r\n\r\n_P. G. Morris_, not less delicate in feeling and execution, became\r\nspecially known by a "Communion in Dieppe." Directly facing the\r\nspectator a train of pretty communicants move upon the seashore,\r\nassuming an air of dignified superiority, like young ladies from\r\nBrighton or Folkestone. A bluish light plays over the white dresses of\r\nthe girls and over the blue jackets of the sailors lounging about the\r\nquay; it fills the pale blue sky with a misty vibration and glances\r\nsportively upon the green waves of the sea. "The Reaper and the Flowers"\r\nwas a thoroughly English picture, a graceful allegory after the fashion\r\nof Fred Walker. On their way from school a party of children meet at the\r\nverge of a meadow an old peasant going home from his day\'s work with a\r\nscythe upon his shoulder. In the dancing step of the little ones may be\r\nseen the influence of Greek statues; they float along as if borne by the\r\nzephyr, with a rhythmical motion which is seldom found in real\r\nschool-children. But the old peasant coming towards them is intended to\r\nrecall the contrast between youth and age as in Fred Walker\'s "Harbour\r\nof Refuge"; while the scythe glittering in the last rays of the setting\r\nsun signifies the scythe of Fate, the scythe of death which does not\r\neven spare the child.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OULESS.   LORD KELVIN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nAnd thus the limits of English painting are defined. It always reveals a\r\ncertain conflict between fact and poetry, reverie and life. For whenever\r\nthe scene does not admit of a directly ethical interpretation, refuge is\r\ninvariably taken in lyricism. The wide field which lies between, where\r\npowerful works are nourished, works which have their roots in reality,\r\nand derive their life from it alone, has not been definitely conquered\r\nby English art. England is the greatest producer and consumer in the\r\nworld, and her people press the marrow out of things as no other have\r\never done: and yet this land of industry knows nothing of pictures in\r\nwhich work is being accomplished; this country, which is a network of\r\nrailway lines, has never seen a railway painted. Even horses are less\r\nand less frequently represented in English art, and sport finds no\r\nexpression there whatever. Much as the Englishman loves it from a sense\r\nof its wholesomeness, he does not consider it sufficiently \xc3\xa6sthetic to\r\nbe painted, a matter upon which Wilkie Collins enlarges in an amusing\r\nway in his book _Man and Wife_.\r\n\r\nAnd in English pictures there are no poor, or, at any rate, none who are\r\nwretched in the extreme. For although the Chelsea Pensioners were a\r\nfavoured theme in painting, there were none of them miserable and\r\nheavy-laden; they were rather types of the happy poor who were carefully\r\ntended. If English painters are otherwise induced to represent the poor,\r\nthey depict a room kept in exemplary order, and endeavour to display\r\nsome touching or admirable trait in honest and admirable people. In\r\nfact, people seem to be good and honourable wherever they are found.\r\nEverywhere there is content and humility, even in misfortune. Even where\r\nactual need is represented, it is only done in the effort to give\r\nexpression to what is moving in certain dispensations of fate, and to\r\ncreate a lofty and conciliating effect by the contrast between\r\nmisfortune and man\'s noble trust in God.\r\n\r\n_John R. Reid_, a Scotchman by birth, but residing in London, has\r\ntreated scenes from life upon the seacoast in this manner. How different\r\nhis works are from the tragedies of Joseph Israels, or the grim\r\nnaturalism of Michael Ancher! He occupies himself only with the bright\r\nside of life with its colour and sunshine, not with the dark side with\r\nits toils. He paints the inhabitants of the country in their Sunday\r\nbest, as they sit telling stories, or as they go a-hunting, or regale\r\nthemselves in the garden of an inn. The old rustics who sit happy with\r\ntheir pipes and beer in his "Cricket Match" are typical of everything\r\nthat he has painted.\r\n\r\nAnd even when, once in a way, a more gloomy trait appears in his\r\npictures, it is there only that the light may shine the more brightly.\r\nThe poor old flute-player who sits homeless upon a bench near the house\r\nis placed there merely to show how well off are the children who are\r\nhurrying merrily home after school. His picture of 1890, indeed, treated\r\na scene of shipwreck, but a passage from a poet stood beneath; there was\r\nnot a lost sailor to be seen, and all the tenderness of the artist is\r\ndevoted to the pretty children and the young women gazing with anxiety\r\nand compassion across the sea.\r\n\r\n_Frank Holl_ was in the habit of giving his pictures a more lachrymose\r\ntouch, together with a more sombre and ascetic harmony of colour. He\r\nborrowed his subjects from the life of the humble classes, always\r\nsearching, moreover, for melancholy features; he took delight in\r\nrepresenting human virtue in misfortune, and for the sake of greater\r\neffect he frequently chose a verse from the Bible as the title. Thus the\r\nwork with which he first won the English public was a picture exhibited\r\nin 1869: "The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name\r\nof the Lord." A family of five brothers and sisters, who have just lost\r\ntheir mother, are assembled round the breakfast-table in a poorly\r\nfurnished room. One sister is crying, another is sadly looking straight\r\nbefore her, whilst a third is praying with folded hands. The younger\r\nbrother, a sailor, has just reached home from a voyage, to close his\r\ndying mother\'s eyes, and the eldest of all, a young and earnest curate,\r\nis endeavouring to console his brothers and sisters with the words of\r\nJob.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  SANT.   THE MUSIC LESSON.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nThe next picture, exhibited in 1871, he called "No Tidings from the\r\nSea," and represented in it a fisherman\'s family--grandmother, mother,\r\nand child--who in a cheerless room are anxiously expecting the return of\r\na sailor. "Leaving Home" showed four people sitting on a bench outside a\r\nwaiting-room at a railway station. To awaken the spectator\'s pity "Third\r\nClass" is written in large letters upon the window just above their\r\nheads. The principal figure is a lady dressed in black, who is counting,\r\nin a somewhat obtrusive manner, the little money which she still has\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nIn the picture "Necessity knows no Law" a poor woman with a child in her\r\narms has entered a pawnshop to borrow money on her wedding-ring; in\r\nanother, women of the poorer class are to be seen walking along with\r\ntheir soldier sons and husbands, who have been called out on active\r\nservice. One of them clasps tightly to her breast her little child, the\r\nonly one still remaining to her in life, whilst an aged widow presses\r\nthe hand of her son with the sad presentiment that, even if he comes\r\nback to her, she will probably not have long to live after his return.\r\nNot only did Frank Holl paint stories for his countrymen, but he also\r\npainted them big in majuscule characters which were legible without\r\nspectacles, and he partially owed his splendid successes to this cheap\r\nsentimentality.\r\n\r\nAlmost everywhere the interest of subject still plays the first part,\r\nand this slightly lachrymose trait bordering on _genre_, this lyrically\r\ntender or allegorically subtle element, which runs through English\r\nfigure pictures, would easily degenerate into vaporous enervation in\r\nanother country. In England portrait painting, which now, as in the days\r\nof Reynolds, is the greatest title to honour possessed by English art,\r\ninvariably maintains its union with direct reality. By acknowledgment\r\nportrait painting in the present day is exceedingly earnest: it admits\r\nof no decorative luxuriousness, no sport with hangings and draperies, no\r\npose; and English likenesses have this severe actuality in the highest\r\ndegree. Stiff-necked obstinacy, sanguine resolution, and muscular force\r\nof will are often spoken of as an Englishman\'s national characteristics,\r\nand a trace of these qualities is also betrayed in English portrait\r\npainting. The self-reliance of the English is far too great to suffer or\r\ndemand any servile habit of flattery: everything is free from pose,\r\nplain and simple. Let the subject be the weather-beaten figure of an old\r\nsailor or the dazzling freshness of English youth, there is a remarkable\r\nenergy and force of life in all their works, even in the pictures of\r\nchildren with their broad open brow, finely chiselled nose, and assured\r\nand penetrative glance. And as portrait painting in England, to its own\r\nadvantage and the benefit of all art, has never been considered as an\r\nisolated province, such pictures may be specified among the works of the\r\nmost frigid academician as well as amongst those of the most vigorous\r\nnaturalist. Frank Holl, who had such a D\xc3\xbcsseldorfian tinge in his more\r\nelaborate pictures, showed at the close of his life, in his likenesses\r\nof the engraver Samuel Cousins, Lord Dufferin, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain,\r\nLord Wolseley, Mr. Gladstone, the Duke of Cleveland, Sir George\r\nTrevelyan, and Lord Spencer, a simple virility altogether wanting in his\r\nearlier works. They had a trenchant characterisation and an unforced\r\npose which were striking even in England. It is scarcely possible to\r\nexhibit people more naturally, or more completely to banish from their\r\nexpression that concentrated air of attentiveness which suggests\r\nphotography and so easily intrudes into a portrait. Even Leighton, so\r\ndevoid of temperament, so entirely devoted to the measured art of the\r\nancients, became at once nervous and almost brutal in his power when he\r\npainted a portrait in place of ideal Grecian figures. His vivid and\r\nforcible portrait of Sir Richard Burton, the celebrated African\r\ntraveller, would do honour to the greatest portrait painter of the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FURSE.   FRONTISPIECE TO "STORIES AND INTERLUDES."]\r\n\r\nAmongst portrait painters by profession _Walter Ouless_ will probably\r\nmerit the place of honour immediately after Watts as an impressive\r\nexponent of character. He has assimilated much from his master\r\nMillais--not merely the heaviness of colour, which often has a\r\ndisturbing effect in the latter, but also Millais\' powerful flight of\r\nstyle, always so free from false rhetoric. The chemical expert Pochin,\r\nas Ouless painted him in 1865, does not pose in the picture nor allow\r\nhimself to be disturbed in his researches. It is a thoroughly\r\ncontemporary portrait, one of those brilliant successes which later\r\noccurred in France also. The Recorder of London, Mr. Russell Gurney, he\r\nlikewise painted in his professional character and in his robes of\r\noffice. In its inflexible graveness and earnest dignity the likeness is\r\nalmost more than the portrait of an individual; it seems the embodiment\r\nof the proud English Bench resting upon the most ancient traditions. His\r\nportrait of Cardinal Manning had the same convincing power of\r\nobservation, the same large and sure technique. The soft light plays\r\nupon the ermine and the red stole, and falls full upon the fine,\r\naustere, and noble face.\r\n\r\nBesides Ouless mention may be made from among the great number of\r\nportrait painters of _J. J. Shannon_, with his powerful and firmly\r\npainted likenesses; of _James Sant_, with his sincere and energetic\r\nportraits of women; of _Mouat Loudan_, with his pretty pictures of\r\nchildren, and of the many-sided _Charles W. Furse_. Hubert Herkomer was\r\nthe most celebrated in Germany, and is probably the most skilful of the\r\nyoung men whom _The Graphic_ brought into eminence in the seventies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mag. of Art._\r\n\r\n  HERKOMER.   JOHN RUSKIN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  HERKOMER.   CHARTERHOUSE CHAPEL.]\r\n\r\nThe career of _Hubert Herkomer_ is amongst those adventurous ones which\r\nbecome less and less frequent in the nineteenth century; there are not\r\nmany who have risen so rapidly to fame and fortune from such modest\r\ncircumstances. His father was a carver of sacred images in the little\r\nBavarian village of Waal, where Hubert was born in 1849. In 1851 the\r\nenterprising Bavarian tried his fortune in the New World. But there he\r\ndid not succeed in making progress, and in 1857 the family appeared in\r\nEngland, at Southampton. Here he fought his way honestly at the bench\r\nwhere he carved, and as a journeyman worker, whilst his wife gave\r\nlessons in music. A commission to carve Peter Vischer\'s four evangelists\r\nin wood brought him with his son to Munich, where they occupied room in\r\nthe back buildings of a master-carpenter\'s house, in which they slept,\r\ncooked, and worked. In the preparatory class of the Munich Academy the\r\nyounger Herkomer received his first teaching, and began to draw from the\r\nnude, the antique serving as model. At a frame-maker\'s in Southampton he\r\ngave his first exhibition, and drew illustrations for a comic paper.\r\nWith the few pence which he saved from these earnings he went to London,\r\nwhere he lived from hand to mouth with a companion as poor as himself.\r\nHe cooked, and his friend scoured the pans; meanwhile he worked as a\r\nmason on the frieze of the South Kensington Museum, and hired himself\r\nout for the evenings as a zither-player. Then _The Graphic_ became his\r\nsalvation, and after his drawings had made him known he soon had success\r\nwith his paintings. "After the Toil of the Day," a picture which he\r\nexhibited in the Royal Academy of 1873--a thoughtful scene from the\r\nvillage life of Bavaria, carried out after the manner of Fred\r\nWalker--found a purchaser immediately. He was then able to make a home\r\nfor his parents in the village of Bushey, which he afterwards glorified\r\nin the picture "Our Village," and he began his masterpiece "The Last\r\nMuster," which obtained in 1878 the great medal at the World Exhibition\r\nin Paris. Since then he found the eyes of the English public fixed upon\r\nhim. There followed at first a series of pictures in which he proceeded\r\nupon the lines of Fred Walker\'s poetic realism: "Eventide," a scene in\r\nthe Westminster Union; "The Gloom of Idwal," a romantic mountain\r\npicture from North Wales; "God\'s Shrine," a lonely Bavarian hillside\r\npath, with peasants praying at a shrine; "Der Bittgang," a group of\r\ncountry people praying for harvest; "Contrasts," a picture of English\r\nladies surrounded by school-children in the Bavarian mountains. At the\r\nsame time he became celebrated as a portrait painter, his first\r\nsuccesses in this field being the likenesses of Wagner and Tennyson,\r\nArchibald Forbes, his own father, John Ruskin, Stanley, and the\r\nconductor Hans Richter. And he reached the summit of his international\r\nfame when his portrait of Miss Grant, "The Lady in White," appeared in\r\n1886; all Europe spoke of it at the time, and it called forth entire\r\nbundles of poems, anecdotes, biographies, and romances. From that time\r\nhe advanced in his career with rapid strides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Art Annual._\r\n\r\n  HERKOMER.   PORTRAIT OF HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nThe University of Oxford appointed him Professor of the Fine Arts. He\r\nopened a School of Art, and had etchings, copper engravings, and\r\nengravings in mezzotint produced by his pupils under his guidance. He\r\nwrote articles in the London papers upon social questions, and political\r\neconomy, and all manner of subjects, an article signed with Herkomer\'s\r\nname being always capable of creating interest. He has his own theatre,\r\nand produces in it operas of which he writes the text and the music, and\r\nmanages the rehearsals and the scenery, besides playing the leading\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  HERKOMER.   HARD TIMES.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Manchester Art Gallery, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nYet it is just his portraits of women, the foundations of his fame,\r\nwhich do not seem in general to justify entirely the painter\'s great\r\nreputation. Miss Grant was certainly a captivating woman, and she broke\r\nmen\'s hearts wherever she made her appearance. People gazed again and\r\nagain into the brilliant brown eyes with which she looked so composedly\r\nbefore her; they were overwhelmed by her austere and lofty virginal\r\nbeauty. "The Lady in Black (An American Lady)" made yet a more piquant\r\nand spiritualised effect. There was the unopened bud, and here the\r\nwoman who has had experience of the delights and disappointments of\r\nlife. There was unapproachable pride, and here a trait of distinction\r\nand of suffering, an almost weary carriage of the body. There would\r\ncertainly be an interesting gallery of beauty if Herkomer unite these\r\n"types of women" in a series. But even in the first picture how much of\r\nall the admiration excited was due to the painter and how much to the\r\nmodel? The portrait of Miss Grant was such a success primarily because\r\nMiss Grant herself was so beautiful. The arrangement of white against\r\nwhite was nothing new: Whistler, a far greater artist, had already\r\npainted a "White Girl" in 1863, and it was a much greater work of art,\r\nthough, on account of the attractiveness of the model being less\r\npowerful, it triumphed only in the narrower circle of artists.\r\nBastien-Lepage, who set himself the same problem in his "Sara\r\nBernhardt," had also run through the scale of white with greater\r\nsureness. And Herkomer\'s later pictures of women--"The Lady in Yellow,"\r\nLady Helen Fergusson, and others--are even less alluring, considered as\r\nworks of art. The reserve and evenness of the execution give his\r\nportraits a somewhat clotted and stiff appearance. Good modelling and\r\nexceedingly vigorous drawing may perhaps ensure great correctness in\r\nthe counterfeit of the originals, but the life of the picture vanishes\r\nbeneath the greasy technique, the soapy painting through which materials\r\nof drapery and flesh-tints assume quite the same values. There is\r\nnothing in it of the transparency, the rosy delicacy, freshness, and\r\nflower-like bloom of Gainsborough\'s women and girls. Herkomer appears in\r\nthese pictures as a salon painter in whom a tame but tastefully\r\ncultivated temperament is expressed with charm. Even his landscapes with\r\ntheir trim peasants\' cottages and their soft moods of sunset have not\r\nenriched with new notes the scale executed by Walker.\r\n\r\nAll the more astonishing is the earnest certainty of touch and the\r\nrobust energy which are visible in his other works. His portraits of\r\nmen, especially the one of his father, that kingly old man with the\r\nlong, white beard and the furrowed brow, take their place beside the\r\nbest productions of English portraiture, which are chiselled, as it\r\nwere, in stone. In "The Last Muster" he showed that it is possible to be\r\nsimple and yet strike a profound note and even attain greatness. For\r\nthere is something great in these old warriors, who at the end of their\r\ndays are praying, having never troubled themselves over prayer during\r\nall their lives, who have travelled so far and staked their lives dozens\r\nof times, and are now drawing their last breath softly upon the seats of\r\na church. Even his more recent groups--"The Assemblage of the Curators\r\nof the Charterhouse" and "The Session of the Magistrates of\r\nLandsberg"--are magnificent examples of realistic art, full of imposing\r\nstrength and soundness. In the representation of these citizens the\r\ngenius of the master who in his "Chelsea Pensioners" created one of the\r\n"Doelen pieces" of the nineteenth century, revealed itself afresh in all\r\nits greatness.\r\n\r\nBeside portrait painting the painting of landscape stands now as ever in\r\nfull bloom amongst the English; not that the artists of to-day are more\r\nconsistently faithful to truth than their predecessors, or that they\r\nseem more modern in the study of light. In the province of landscape as\r\nin that of figure painting, far more weight is laid upon subject than on\r\nthe moods of atmosphere. If one compares the modern English painters\r\nwith Crome and Constable, one finds them wanting in boldness and\r\ncreative force; and placed beside Monet, they seem to be diffident\r\naltogether. But a touching reverence for nature gives almost all their\r\npictures a singularly chaste and fragrant charm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mag. of Art._\r\n\r\n  HERKOMER.   THE LAST MUSTER.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Boussod, Valadon & Co., the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  HERKOMER.   FOUND.]\r\n\r\nOf course, all the influences which have affected English art in other\r\nrespects are likewise reflected in landscape painting. The epoch-making\r\nactivity of the pre-Raphaelites, the passionate earnestness of Ruskin\'s\r\nlove for nature, as well as the influence of foreign art, have all left\r\ntheir traces. In his own manner Constable had spoken the last word. The\r\nprincipal thing in him, as in Cox, was the study of atmospheric effects\r\nand of the dramatic life of air. They neither of them troubled\r\nthemselves about local colour, but sought to render the tones which are\r\nformed under atmospheric and meteorological influences; they altogether\r\nsacrificed the completion of the details of subject to seizing the\r\nmomentary impression. In Turner, generally speaking, it was only the air\r\nthat lived. Trees and buildings, rocks and water, are merely\r\n_repoussoirs_ for the atmosphere; they are exclusively ordained to lead\r\nthe eye through the mysterious depths of light and shadow. The\r\nintangible absorbed what could be touched and handled. As a natural\r\nreaction there came this pre-Raphaelite landscape, and by a curious\r\nirony of chance the writer who had done most for Turner\'s fame was also\r\nhe who first welcomed this pre-Raphaelite landscape school. Everything\r\nwhich the old school had neglected now became the essential object of\r\npainting. The landscape painters fell in love with the earth, with the\r\nwoods and the fields; and the more autumn resolved the wide green\r\nharmony of nature into a sport of colours multiplied a thousand times,\r\nthe more did they love it. Thousands of things were there to be seen.\r\nFirst, how the foliage turned yellow and red and brown, and then how it\r\nfell away: how it was scattered upon a windy day, whirling in a yellow\r\ndrift of leaves; how in still weather leaf after leaf lightly rustled to\r\nthe ground from between the wavering brown boughs. And then when the\r\nfoliage fell from the trees and bushes the most inviolate secrets of\r\nsummer came to light; there lay around quantities of bright seeds and\r\nberries rich in colour, brown nuts, smooth acorns, black and glossy\r\nsloes, and scarlet haws. In the leafless beeches there clustered pointed\r\nbeechmast, the mugwort bent beneath its heavy red bunches, late\r\nblackberries lay black and brown amid the damp foliage upon the road,\r\nbilberries grew amid the heather, and wild raspberries bore their dull\r\nred fruit once again. The dying ferns took a hundred colours; the moss\r\nshot up like the ears of a miniature cornfield. Eager as children the\r\nlandscape painters roamed here and there across the woodland, to\r\ndiscover its treasures and its curiosities. They understood how to paint\r\na bundle of hay with such exactness that a botanist could decide upon\r\nthe species of every blade. One of them lived for three months under\r\ncanvas, so as thoroughly to know a landscape of heath. Confused through\r\ndetail, they lost their view of the whole, and only made a return to\r\nmodernity when they came to study the Parisian landscape painters. Thus\r\nEnglish art in this matter made a curious circuit, giving and taking.\r\nFirst, the English fertilised French art; but at the time when French\r\nartists stood under the influence of the English, the latter swerved in\r\nthe opposite direction, until they ultimately received from France the\r\nimpulse which led them back into the old way.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these different influences, several currents which\r\ncross and mingle with each other are to be found flowing side by side in\r\nEnglish landscape painting: upon one side a spirit of prosaic\r\nreasonableness, a striving after clearness and precision, which does not\r\nknow how to sacrifice detail, and is therefore wanting in pictorial\r\ntotality of effect; on the other side an artistic pantheism which rises\r\nat times to high lyrical poetry in spite of many dissonances.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of _Cecil Lawson_ lead to the point where the\r\npre-Raphaelites begin. The elder painters, with their powerful treatment\r\nand the freedom and boldness of their execution, still keep altogether\r\non the lines of Constable, whereas in later painters, with their minute\r\nelaboration of all particularities, the influence of the pre-Raphaelites\r\nbecomes more and more apparent.\r\n\r\nWhere Cecil Lawson ended, _James Clarke Hook_ began, the great\r\nmaster-spirit who opened the eyes of the world fifty years ago to the\r\ndepth of colouring and the enchanting life of nature, even in its\r\nindividual details. His pictures, especially those sunsets which he\r\npaints with such delight, have something devout and religious in them;\r\nthey have the effect of a prayer or a hymn, and often possess a\r\nsolemnity which is entirely biblical, in spite of their brusque, pungent\r\ncolours. In his later period he principally devoted himself to\r\nsea-pieces, and in doing so receded from the pre-Raphaelite painting of\r\ndetail, which is characteristic of his youthful period. His pictures\r\ngive one the breath of the sea, and his sailors are old sea-wolves. All\r\nthat remains from his pre-Raphaelite period is that, as a rule, they\r\ncarry a certain burden of ideas.\r\n\r\n_Vicat Cole_, likewise one of the older school, is unequal and less\r\nimportant. From many of his pictures one receives the impression that he\r\nhas directly copied Constable, and others are bathed in dull yellow\r\ntones; nevertheless he has sometimes painted autumn pictures, felicitous\r\nand noble landscapes, in which there is really a reflection of the sun\r\nof Claude Lorrain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  LAWSON.   THE MINISTER\'S GARDEN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nWith much greater freedom does _Colin Hunter_ approach nature, and he\r\nhas the secret of seizing her boldly in her most impressive moments. The\r\ntwilight, with its mysterious, interpenetrating tremor of colours of a\r\nthousand shades, its shine and glimmer of water, with the sky brooding\r\nheavily above, is what fascinates him most of all. Sometimes he\r\nrepresents the dawn, as in "The Herring Market at Sea"; sometimes the\r\npale tawny sunset, as in "The Gatherers of Seaweed," in the South\r\nKensington Museum. His men are always in a state of restless activity,\r\nwhether they are making the most of the last moments of light or facing\r\nthe daybreak with renewed energies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  COLIN HUNTER.   THE HERRING MARKET AT SEA.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nAlthough resident in London, he and Hook are the true standard-bearers\r\nof the forcible Scotch school of landscape. _MacCallum_, _MacWhirter_,\r\nand _James Macbeth_, with whom _John Brett_, the landscape painter of\r\nCornwall, may be associated, are all gnarled, Northern personalities.\r\nTheir strong, dark tones stand often beside each other with a little\r\nhardness, but they sum up the great glimpses of nature admirably. Their\r\nbrush has no tenderness, their spirit does not lightly yield to\r\ndreaminess, but they stand with both feet firmly planted on the earth,\r\nand they clasp reality in a sound and manly fashion with both arms.\r\nTheir deep-toned pictures, with red wooden houses, darkly painted\r\nvessels, veiled skies, and rude fishermen with all their heart in their\r\nwork, waken strong and intimate emotions. The difference between these\r\nScots and the tentative spirits of the younger generation of the\r\nfollowing of Walker and Mason is like that between Rousseau and Dupr\xc3\xa9 as\r\nopposed to Chintreuil and Daubigny. The Scotch painters are sombre and\r\nvirile; they have an accent of depth and truth, and a dark, ascetic\r\nharmony of colour. Even as landscape painters the English love what is\r\ndelicate in nature, what is refined and tender, familiar and modest:\r\nblossoming apple-trees and budding birches, the odour of the cowshed and\r\nthe scent of hay, the chime of sheep-bells and the hum of gnats. They\r\nseek no great emotions, but are merely amiable and kindly, and their\r\npictures give one the feeling of standing at the window upon a country\r\nexcursion, and looking out at the laughing and budding spring. In her\r\nnovel _North and South_ Mrs. Gaskell has given charming expression to\r\nthe glow of this feeling of having fled from the smoke and dirt of\r\nindustrial towns to breathe the fresh air and see the sun go down in the\r\nprosperous country, where the meadows are fresh and well-kept, and where\r\nthe flowers are fragrant and the leaves glisten in the sunshine. In the\r\npictures of the Scotch artists toiling men are moving busily; for the\r\nEnglish, nature merely exists that man may have his pleasure in her. Not\r\nonly is everything which renders her the prosaic handmaiden of mankind\r\nscrupulously avoided, but all abruptnesses of landscape, all the chance\r\nincidents of mountain scenery; and, indeed, they are not of frequent\r\noccurrence in nature as she is in England. A familiar corner of the\r\ncountry is preferred to wide prospects, and some quiet phase to nature\r\nin agitation. Soft, undulating valleys, gently spreading hills\r\nconforming to the Hogarthian line of beauty, are especially favoured.\r\nAnd should the rainbow, the biblical symbol of atonement, stand in the\r\nsky, the landscape is for English eyes in the zenith of its beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  AUMONIER.   THE SILVER LINING TO THE CLOUD.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._\r\n\r\n  COLIN HUNTER.   THEIR ONLY HARVEST.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  HENRY MOORE.   MOUNT\'S BAY.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nThere is _Birket Forster_, one of the first and most energetic followers\r\nof Walker--Birket Forster, whose charming woodcuts became known in\r\nGermany likewise; _Inchbold_, who with a light hand combines the tender\r\ngreen of the grasses upon the dunes and the bright blue of the sea into\r\na whole pervaded with light, and of great refinement; _Leader_, whose\r\nbright evening landscapes, and _Corbet_, whose delicate moods of\r\nmorning, are so beautiful. _Mark Fisher_, who in the matter of tones\r\nclosely follows the French landscape school, though he remains entirely\r\nEnglish in sentiment, has painted with great artistic power the dreamy\r\npeace of solitary regions as well as the noisy and busy life of the\r\npurlieus of the town. _John White_, in 1882, signalised himself with a\r\nlandscape, "Gold and Silver," which was bathed in light and air. The\r\ngold was a waving cornfield threaded by a sandy little yellow path; the\r\nsilver was the sea glittering and sparkling in the background. Moved by\r\nBirket Forster, _Ernest Parton_ seeks to combine refinement of tone with\r\nincisiveness in the painting of detail. His motives are usually quite\r\nsimple--a stream and a birch wood in the dusk, a range of poplars\r\nstretching dreamily along the side of a ditch. _Marshall_ painted gloomy\r\nLondon streets enveloped in mist; _Docharty_ blossoming hawthorn bushes\r\nand autumn evening with russet-leaved oaks; while _Alfred East_ became\r\nthe painter of spring in all its fragrance, when the meadows are\r\nresplendent in their earliest verdure, and the leaves of the trees which\r\nhave just unfolded stand out against the firmament in light green\r\npatches of colour, when the limes are blossoming and the crops begin to\r\nsprout. _M. J. Aumonier_ appears in the harmony of colouring, and in the\r\nsoftness of his fine, light-hued tones, as the true heir of Walker and\r\nMason. A discreet and intimate sense of poetry pervades his valleys with\r\ntheir veiled and golden light, a fertile odour of the earth streams from\r\nhis rich meadows, and from all the luxuriant, cultivated, and peacefully\r\nidyllic tracts which he has painted so lovingly and so well. _Gregory_,\r\n_Knight_, _Alfred Parsons_, _David Fulton_, _A. R. Brown_, and _St.\r\nClair Simmons_ have all something personal in their work, a bashful\r\ntenderness beneath what is seemingly arid. The study of water-colour\r\nwould alone claim a chapter for itself. Since water-colour allows of\r\nmore breadth and unity than oil-painting, it is precisely here that\r\nthere may be found exceedingly charming and discreet concords, softly\r\nchiming tones of delicate blue, greenish, and rosy light, giving the\r\nmost refined sensations produced by English colouring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mag. of Art._\r\n\r\n  LUKE FILDES.   VENETIAN WOMEN.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Berlin Photographic Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nOf course, England has a great part to play in the painting of the sea.\r\nIt is not for nothing that a nation occupies an insular and maritime\r\nposition, above all with such a sea and upon such coasts, and the\r\nEnglish painter knows well how to give an heroic and poetic cast to the\r\nweather-beaten features of the sailor. For thirty years _Henry Moore_,\r\nthe elder brother of Albert Moore, was the undisputed monarch of this\r\nprovince of art. Moore began as a landscape painter. From 1853 to 1857\r\nhe painted the glistening cliffs and secluded nooks of Cumberland, and\r\nthen the green valleys of Switzerland flooded with the summer air and\r\nthe clear morning light--quiet scenes of rustic life, the toil of the\r\nwood-cutter and the haymaker, somewhat as Julien Dupr\xc3\xa9 handles such\r\nmatters at the present time in Paris. From 1858 he began his conquest of\r\nthe sea, and in the succeeding interval he painted it in all the phases\r\nof its changing life,--at times in grey and sombre morning, at other\r\ntimes when the sun stands high; at times in quietude, at other times\r\nwhen the wind sweeps heavily across the waves, when the storm rises or\r\nsubsides, when the sky is clouded or when it brightens. It is a joy to\r\nfollow him in all quarters of the world, to see how he constantly\r\nstudies the waves of every zone on fair or stormy days, amid the\r\nclearness and brilliancy of the mirror of the sea, as amid the strife of\r\nthe elements; as a painter he is, at the same time, always a student of\r\nnature, and treats the sea as though he had to paint its portrait. In\r\nthe presence of his sea-pieces one has the impression of a window\r\nopening suddenly upon the ocean. Henry Moore measures the boundless\r\nexpanse quite calmly, like a captain calculating the chances of being\r\nable to make a crossing. Nowhere else does there live any painter who\r\nregards the sea so much with the eyes of a sailor, and who combines such\r\neminent qualities with this objective and cool, attentive observation,\r\nwhich seems to behold in the sea merely its navigable capacity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._\r\n\r\n  STANHOPE FORBES.   THE LIGHTHOUSE.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Corporation of Manchester, the owners of the\r\n  picture._)]\r\n\r\nThe painter of the river-port of London and the arm of the Thames is\r\n_William L. Wyllie_, whose pictures unite so much bizarre grandeur with\r\nso much precision. One knows the port life of the Thames, with its\r\naccumulation of work, which has not its like upon the whole planet.\r\nEverything is colossal. From Greenwich up to London both sides of the\r\nriver are a continuous quay: everywhere there are goods being piled,\r\nsacks being raised on pulleys, ships being laid at anchor; everywhere\r\nare fresh storehouses for copper, beer, sails, tar, and chemicals. The\r\nriver is of great width, and is like a street populated with ships, a\r\nworkshop winding again and again. The steamers and sailing vessels move\r\nup and down stream, or lie in masses, close beside one another, at\r\nanchor. Upon the bank the docks lie athwart like so many streets of\r\nwater, sending out ships or taking them in. The ranks of masts and the\r\nslender rigging form a spider\'s web spreading across the whole horizon;\r\nand a vaporous haze, penetrated by the sun, envelops it with a reddish\r\nveil. Every dock is like a town, filled with huge vats and populated\r\nwith a swarm of human beings, that move hither and thither amid\r\nfluttering shadows. This vast panorama, veiled with smoke and mist, only\r\nnow and then broken by a ray of sunlight, is the theme of Wyllie\'s\r\npictures. Even as a child he ran about in the port of London, clambered\r\non to the ships, noted the play of the waves, and wandered about the\r\ndocks; and so he painted his pictures afterwards with all the technical\r\nknowledge of a sailor. There is no one who knows so well how ships stand\r\nin the water; no one has such an understanding of their details: the\r\nheavy sailing vessels and the great steamers, which lie in the brown\r\nwater of the port like mighty monsters, the sailors and the movements of\r\nthe dock labourers, the dizzy tide of men, the confusion of cabs and\r\ndrays upon the bridges spanning the arm of the Thames; only Vollon in\r\nParis is to be compared with him as painter of a river-port.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. ANNING BELL.   OBERON AND TITANIA WITH THEIR TRAIN.]\r\n\r\nApart from him, _Clara Montalba_ specially has painted the London port\r\nin delicate water-colours. Yet she is almost more at home in Venice, the\r\nVenice of Francesco Guardi, with its magic gleam, its canals, regattas,\r\nand palaces, the Oriental and dazzling splendour of San Marco, the\r\naustere grace of San Giorgio Maggiore, the spirited and fantastic\r\n_d\xc3\xa9cadence_ of Santa Maria della Salute. Elsewhere English water-colour\r\noften enters into a fruitless rivalry with oil-painting, but Clara\r\nMontalba cleaves to the old form which in other days under Bonington,\r\nDavid Cox, and Turner was the chief glory of the English school. She\r\nthrows lightly upon paper notes and effects which have struck her, and\r\nthe memory of which she wishes to retain.\r\n\r\nFor the English painters of the day, so far as they do not remain in the\r\ncountry, Venice has become what the East was for the earlier\r\ngenerations. They no longer study the romantic Venice which Turner\r\npainted and Byron sang in _Childe Harold_, they do not paint the noble\r\nbeauty of Venetian architecture or its canals glowing in the sun, but\r\nthe Venice of the day, with its narrow alleys and pretty girls, Venice\r\nwith its marvellous effects of light and the picturesque figures of its\r\nstreets. Nor are they at pains to discover "ideal" traits in the\r\ncharacter of the Italian people. They paint true, everyday scenes from\r\npopular life, but these are glorified by the magic of light. After\r\nZezzos, Ludwig Passini, Cecil van Haanen, Tito, and Eug\xc3\xa8ne Blaas, the\r\nEnglishmen Luke Fildes, W. Logsdail, and Henry Woods are the most\r\nskilful painters of Venetian street scenes. In the pictures of _Luke\r\nFildes_ and _W. Logsdail_ there are usually to be seen in the foreground\r\nbeautiful women, painted life-size, washing linen in the canal or seated\r\nknitting at the house door; the heads are bright and animated, the\r\ncolours almost glaringly vivid. _Henry Woods_, the brother-in-law of\r\nLuke Fildes, rather followed the paths prescribed by Favretto in such\r\npictures as "Venetian Trade in the Streets," "The Sale of an Old\r\nMaster," "Preparation or the First Communion," "Back from the Rialto,"\r\nand the like; of all the English he has carried out the study of bright\r\ndaylight most consistently. The little glass house which he built in\r\n1879 at the back of the Palazzo Vendramin became the model of all the\r\nglass studios now disseminated over the city of the lagunes.\r\n\r\nAnd these labours in Venice contributed in no unessential manner to lead\r\nEnglish painting, in general, away from its one-sided \xc3\xa6sthetics and\r\nrather more into the mud of the streets, caused it to break with its\r\nfinely accorded tones, and brought it to a more earnest study of light.\r\nBeside his idealised Venetian women, Luke Fildes also painted large\r\npictures from the life of the English people, such as "The Return of the\r\nLost One," "The Widower," and the like, which struck tones more earnest\r\nthan English painting does elsewhere; and in his picture of 1878, "The\r\nPoor of London," he even recalled certain sketches which Gavarni drew\r\nduring his rambles through the poverty-stricken quarter of London. The\r\npoor starving figures in this work were rendered quite realistically and\r\nwithout embellishment; the general tone was a greenish-grey, making a\r\nforcible change from the customary light blue of English pictures.\r\n_Dudley Hardy\'s_ huge picture "Homeless," where a crowd of human beings\r\nare sleeping at night in the open air at the foot of a monument in\r\nLondon, and _Jacomb Hood\'s_ plain scenes from London street life, are\r\nother works which in recent years were striking, from having a character\r\nrather French than English. _Stott of Oldham_, by his pretty pictures of\r\nthe dunes with children playing, powerful portraits, and delicate,\r\nvaporous moonlight landscapes, has won many admirers on the Continent\r\nalso. _Stanhope Forbes_ painted "A Philharmonic Society in the Country,"\r\na representation of an auction, and scenes from the career of the\r\nSalvation Army, in which he restrained himself from all subordinate\r\nideas of a poetic turn.\r\n\r\nIn the same way those artists are important who work according to the\r\ndemands of decorative painting. A picture in a room should be like a\r\njewel in its setting, in harmony. It should fit agreeably into the\r\nscheme of decoration, its colour in unison, its lines melodious, its\r\ngeneral effect toning well with the general design.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANGWYN.   ILLUSTRATION TO THE RUB\xc3\x81IY\xc3\x81T OF OMAR KHAYY\xc3\x81M.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of Messrs. Gibbings & Co., the owners of the\r\n  copyright._)]\r\n\r\nThese principles, taught by Morris, have had a formative influence on\r\nthe work of a large number of artists. There arose a tendency which, by\r\nborrowing characteristic effects from woodwork, carpets, and\r\nstained-glass, and by the application of style to line as well as to\r\ncolour, went one step further than Burne-Jones.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of _John W. Waterhouse_, for instance, are not only\r\nconceived in literary vein, but seen with the eye of a painter. By\r\nsmooth, thick lines, by the discordant harmony of blues, greens, and\r\nviolet, he gets a carpet-like effect which is highly decorative.\r\n\r\n_Byam Shaw_, still a young man, is just such another master of\r\ndecorative lines. At the age of twenty-five he painted the picture\r\n"Love\'s Baubles," which now hangs in the art gallery in Liverpool. The\r\nsubject he took from a poem in Rossetti\'s "House of Life." Beautiful\r\nwomen snatch after the fruit which a boy carries along on a salver. The\r\nwhole is a harmony of melodious lines and rich, quiet colours.\r\n\r\nIn his next picture, "Truth," he ranges himself with Boutet de Monoel or\r\nLudwig von Zumbusch: he strives after the monumental effect that the\r\nfigures of old Brueghel have.\r\n\r\nNext to Byam Shaw, _G. E. Moira_ is the chief representative of this\r\ndecorative school. His picture of Pelleas and Melisande is a work quite\r\nout of the ordinary, original in arrangement, incisive, almost bitter in\r\ncolour, dull-green, black, lilac, and yellow; fine in the atmosphere of\r\nMaeterlinck that pervades the whole. But he does his best work as a\r\ndecorator, not as a painter of pictures that can be taken away from\r\ntheir setting. In the frieze with which he decorated the Trocad\xc3\xa9ro\r\nRestaurant in London he, for the first time, made use of polychrome\r\nrelief, that since has played such an important part in the art of\r\ndecoration, and sought to enhance the colour effect still more by the\r\nuse of metal. In the Paris Exhibition he attracted considerable\r\nattention by the pictures with which he decorated the pavilion of the\r\nPeninsular and Oriental Steamship Company--simple lines and fantasies of\r\ncolour which with their delicate, flowing harmony had an effect like\r\nmusic. His designs for stained-glass windows have the same qualities,\r\nand in his position as professor in the National College of Art at South\r\nKensington he is bound to exert a great influence over the younger\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n_Anning Bell_, well known by his design for the cover of the _Studio_,\r\nhas also done excellent work in coloured relief, especially in his\r\nfrieze "Music and Dancing."\r\n\r\n_Maurice Greiffenhagen_ surprises one by the ardour of his imagination,\r\nhis strong emphatic line, and the tapestry-like beauty of his colour. He\r\nreminds one of Aman-Jean, such a wonderful "old-master-like" beauty is\r\nsuffused through the picture "The Sons of God looked upon the Daughters\r\nof Men." No less effective is the "gourmandise" with which he gives his\r\ninterpretation the appearance of an old picture. The colours, though\r\nfull of sound and movement, are at the same time so etiolated and faint\r\nthat one would think the picture had hung for centuries in a dusty\r\ncorner of an old church, or that spiders had spun their webs across it;\r\nthe frame too is in keeping, and enhances the general effect of\r\nsolemnity.\r\n\r\nThe same style is found in the later work of _Frank Brangwyn_, who began\r\nby painting out-of-door pictures in the spirit of the French\r\nImpressionists, and afterwards, thanks to a visit to the East, was\r\nbrought into touch with Nature saturated in colour and massive in\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F. CAYLEY ROBINSON.   A WINTER EVENING.\r\n\r\n  (_By permission of the Artist._)]\r\n\r\nAll his works are imposing through the decisive way in which he builds\r\nup his masses, and the wonderful, rhythmical articulation of forms and\r\ncolours combined. The picture "Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh" which has\r\nbeen given a place in the Luxembourg, and the large mural painting\r\n"Commerce and Navigation" in the Royal Exchange in London, are up to now\r\nhis strongest work.\r\n\r\n_F. Cayley Robinson_, who arrests one\'s attention with his austere,\r\nalmost heraldic arrangement of line, and his gloomy acerbity of colour;\r\n_Miss Eleanor Fortescue Brickdale_, who awoke high hopes with her\r\npicture "The Deceitfulness of Riches"; and that spirited draughtsman, W.\r\nNicholson, whose drawings lead the eye to and fro, backwards and\r\nforwards, along heavy decided lines, noting every expressive turn and\r\nmovement. Almost all these masters have come to us from the applied\r\narts. It was the idea of attaining to unity of effect in decorative\r\nornament that impelled these artists to work in the spirit of to-day,\r\nnot that each should bring forward his own work of art and let it stand\r\nby itself, but that the scheme of decorative architecture, modelling,\r\nand painting should work together hand in hand in a homogeneous scheme\r\nof decoration.\r\n\r\nWith all these artists one cannot help noticing that they owe much in\r\nthe way of light and leading to one who in England, the land of\r\npoems-in-paint, proclaimed more outspokenly than anyone else the\r\nprinciple of "Art for art\'s sake,"--to the great American, James M\'Neill\r\nWhistler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn General:\r\n\r\n  John Ruskin: Letters to "The Times" on the Principal Pre-Raphaelite\r\n  Pictures in the Exhibition of 1854.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\r\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\r\nFoundation\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
